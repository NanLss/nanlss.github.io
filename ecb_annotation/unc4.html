<h1>List of 'no comment' sentences, by negation words</h1>
</div>
<br></br>
<body>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'any (179)'}</b></div><p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> draw your attention to the fact that in <span class='negation'>any</span> case when <span class='subject'>we</span> produce a g7 communiqu√©, because you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> g7, it is signed by ministers and central bank governors. </p>
<p>so, purchases are intended to run until the end of september 2016, and in <span class='negation'>any</span> case until <span class='subject'>we</span> see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation that is consistent with <span class='subject'>our</span> aim of achieving inflation rates over etc etc, and then there is this new sentence <span class='comment'>explaining</span> exactly what <span class='subject'>we</span> mean by sustained and by medium-term. </p>
<p>it would be premature for <span class='subject'>me</span> to make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> about that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do what <span class='subject'>we</span> have to do at <span class='negation'>any</span> time ; <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that it is <span class='subject'>our</span> duty and <span class='subject'>our</span> responsibility to be, if <span class='subject'>i</span> may say so, neither behind the curve nor ahead of the curve, but to do at <span class='negation'>any</span> given time exactly what <span class='subject'>we</span> judge appropriate. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>any</span> proposals that could emerge from the eu council will certainly be <span class='comment'>examined</span> very carefully by <span class='subject'>us</span>, with the idea that <span class='subject'>we</span> can improve things. </p>
<p>to your first question: <span class='negation'>any</span> indications that could be given in respect of a possible weakening of the fiscal consolidation would be against, <span class='subject'>i</span> repeat, against the decisions that have been taken by the various governments themselves, against the recommendations and decisions that have been taken within the framework of the stability and growth pact upon the proposal of the commission and against the berlin agreement <span class='subject'>i</span> referred to in the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>. </p>
<p>on the spanish request, <span class='subject'>i</span> will decline to make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, now that <span class='subject'>we</span> have been <span class='comment'>examining</span> the euro area for 11 years, <span class='subject'>we</span> have observed that you have the same overall big business cycle at the level of the euro area as a whole, and then you have country differences compared with the business cycle of the euro area. </p>
<p>in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, when <span class='subject'>we</span> meet after the next monetary policy meeting, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>tell</span> you what has been decided for the non-standard measures. </p>
<p>in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that there is still a high level of uncertainty, and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> the risks to be broadly balanced. </p>
<p>now, let <span class='subject'>me</span> say the following: <span class='negation'>any</span> kind of <span class='comment'>comments</span> from <span class='subject'>my</span> side about a possible change of <span class='subject'>our</span> own mandate is totally out of the question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am obviously aware that markets read and understand and try to interpret <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>remark</span> made by the president of the ecb in these press conferences. </p>
<p>and of course, and this is another issue on which <span class='subject'>my</span> views are well known, in this country at <span class='negation'>any</span> rate, <span class='subject'>i</span> believe that public finance in this country should have sufficient room for manoeuvre in order to better cope with <span class='comment'>expected</span> substantial increases in age-related expenditure, because greece is faced with one of the worst problems of an ageing population, which will have serious consequences for both healthcare and pension system expenditure. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'beyond (9)'}</b></div><p>as regards further non-standard measures, on top of the two measures <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>, on top of what <span class='subject'>we</span> have decided today -- to say that <span class='subject'>we</span> would continue as long as needed and <span class='negation'>beyond</span> the end of the year -- <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>discussing</span> and studying possible new non-standard measures. </p>
<p>to the first question <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll <span class='comment'>answer</span>, basically, reading again what is in the introductory statement: additional stimulus <span class='negation'>beyond</span> the impetus already taken into account is <span class='comment'>expected</span> from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, namely the tltro ii and the cspp, and will contribute to further rebalancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation. </p>
<p>and, for what will come <span class='negation'>beyond</span> the second and third quarters, <span class='subject'>i</span> would refer you to the rendezvous <span class='subject'>i</span> had already <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> to your colleagues, to the meeting in september. </p>
<p>going <span class='negation'>beyond</span> council members ' views and opinions, when <span class='subject'>i</span> say it is fully justified <span class='subject'>i</span> look at the facts: at the markets ' reaction, at the rates, at a list of things that <span class='subject'>i</span> briefly <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> before -- bank bonds issuance, yields, the repositioning of the forward curve to where it was in may, and so on. </p>
<p>over and <span class='negation'>beyond</span> this <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> will do all that is necessary to ensure price stability and be credible in delivering price stability, in order to remain fully in line with the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have underlined twice in <span class='subject'>my</span> introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>. </p>
<p>it would go <span class='negation'>beyond</span> a responsible <span class='comment'>answer</span> if <span class='subject'>i</span> already drew conclusions from that in the direction of" safe haven '' functions. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'difficult (18)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p>it is <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>answer</span> with a yes or <span class='negation'>no</span>, but have <span class='subject'>we</span> designed the esm with the aim of it becoming a shareholder in banks in the euro area? </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'difficult (18)', 'not (1281)'}</b></div><p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> yet said what the ecb is going to do about greece, it is a very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> question to <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>so if <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on pronouncements, you can imagine how <span class='negation'>difficult</span> it is to form an expectation on that. </p>
<p>clearly, the insurance companies try to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to this situation in a variety of ways, which <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>discuss</span>, because some of them have to do with their business models, but certainly it 's quite clear that certain regulatory provisions make their task of diversifying their investments into higher yield and potentially more liquid investments more <span class='negation'>difficult</span>. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'difficult (18)'}</b></div><p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that the question is too <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>answer</span> in a clear and unambiguous way. </p>
<p>it has, of course, worked in small countries: whether it can work in a large area is <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to assess, but this is certainly something <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>considered</span>. </p>
<p>so it 's very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to your question whether <span class='subject'>we</span> have in mind a level of the exchange rate. </p>
<p>the events that <span class='subject'>we</span> are dealing with are <span class='negation'>difficult</span> and challenging, and they require that all authorities <span class='comment'>respond</span> in a manner which is consistent with the scale of the challenge. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think experience actually teaches only up to a point, because it is very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to these questions. </p>
<p>on the first issue, it is very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>respond</span> because the labour market reform is now being <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the parliament. </p>
<p>and as many things in japan are <span class='negation'>difficult</span> for <span class='subject'>us</span> to understand, and even more <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>explain</span>, such is the case with the exchange rate of the japanese yen. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> find it very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>answer</span> that question, for <span class='subject'>me</span> it clears the horizon. </p>
<p>on the first question, these are volumes and they follow also principles of market neutrality and so it 's <span class='negation'>difficult</span> for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>answer</span> your question now. </p>
<p>and so from this viewpoint it would be <span class='negation'>difficult</span> for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the prospects for structural reforms in that country. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>commented</span> on such matters at <span class='negation'>any</span> time in the past. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> intervention, so you will find out what <span class='subject'>we</span> have done when the time comes, namely next monday. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> stick to that, and as you know, you will <span class='negation'>never</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span> from <span class='subject'>me</span> on the intervention concept. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p>on the first question, on interventions, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>: so, <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on your first question on interventions. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> anything like that </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)', 'not (1281)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>as regards the dialogue with jean-claude juncker in preparation of the g7, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>never</span> had <span class='negation'>any</span> problem of that kind in the past, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> such problem in the future. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)', 'not (1281)'}</b></div><p>on the smp, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> on behalf of the governing council limits of the programme and so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> do so now either. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> pre-commit in advance and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what could happen in the months to come. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> -- <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> -- on the market on a short-term basis. </p>
<p>the first question, as you said actually very correctly, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>, because <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> pre-commit. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> remember, because <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other central bank policies. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what <span class='subject'>my</span> colleagues say, because they do <span class='negation'>not</span> speak on behalf of the governing council. </p>
<p>on the second part of your question, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> because <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> pre-commit. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> really <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rates, and even less so on levels of exchange rates, or whether a certain level is appropriate or <span class='negation'>not</span>. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)', 'without (15)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that, but <span class='subject'>i</span> have full confidence that the government of latvia will take the decisions that are appropriate for the domestic context <span class='negation'>without</span> a change in the currency. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (71)'}</b></div><p>as regards your first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what colleagues say. </p>
<p>regarding the possibility of the ecb purchasing such instruments, it was <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> and <span class='subject'>i</span> think it will <span class='negation'>never</span> be <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, let alone decided. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span>, ever <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market developments. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>, as you know, on the exchange rate on a day-to-day basis. </p>
<p>on the other question, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> really <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other jurisdictions ' policies, but if this is necessary to achieve the inflation objectives and more generally, more broadly, the objectives of the federal reserve 's monetary policy, this is a plus for the world. </p>
<p>as regards your first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>commented</span> that <span class='subject'>i</span> would attribute predictability to the wisdom and lucidity of observers, but <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on immediate reactions that the introductory statement could trigger in the market. </p>
<p>you will be aware that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>so whoever wants to ask <span class='subject'>me</span> about switzerland, just you should know ; <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other central banks ' decisions. </p>
<p>and the second question is a very hypothetical one on a change in the monetary policy stance in japan, and, well, let <span class='subject'>me</span> say that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> give <span class='comment'>answers</span> to hypothetical questions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the decisions which are taken by the bank of japan or the federal reserve or other fellow central bank governors. </p>
<p>since then, <span class='subject'>we</span> frankly <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that, period. </p>
<p>with regard to the exchange rate, as you know, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rates, but <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> should keep to the g7 communiqu√© of 8 august 2011, in which <span class='subject'>we</span> reaffirmed <span class='subject'>our</span> shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system and <span class='subject'>our</span> support for market-determined exchange rates. </p>
<p>on your first question: as you know, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>, on the day to day evolution of markets in general, and much less so in real time at this very moment ! </p>
<p>on the interventions, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>you know that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the question" how do you balance the risk for inflation on the one hand and the risk for growth on the other hand? '' </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> that there was a" quick fix '' that could allow <span class='subject'>us</span> to resolve that situation, and everything that has happened since then has proved that <span class='subject'>our</span> analysis was right. </p>
<p>taking the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> a number of times that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market rumours. </p>
<p>on your last point, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the <span class='comment'>comments</span> of colleagues. </p>
<p>the first question is really, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>addressed</span> that. </p>
<p>in <span class='subject'>our</span> case, <span class='subject'>we</span> 've <span class='negation'>never</span> been disappointed by the timeliness with which the staff and committees have <span class='comment'>responded</span>. </p>
<p>on the first question, you know that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the exchange rates, except when <span class='subject'>i</span> have something to say. </p>
<p>but the bottom line is <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. '' </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sorry, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is the same: <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p>and, as regards intervention, you know also that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such matters. </p>
<p>on voting <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> questions, with the exception of on the voting modalities where <span class='subject'>we</span> had to be unanimous, and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>told</span> you <span class='subject'>we</span> were and are unanimous. </p>
<p>as regards the rumours, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> confirm to you that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such matters. </p>
<p>well, let <span class='subject'>me</span> first just point out that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> deflation. </p>
<p>as regards the future, <span class='subject'>i</span> would only say that, as you rightly <span class='comment'>mention</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> pre-commit: <span class='subject'>we</span> always do what is appropriate to be able to <span class='comment'>tell</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens that <span class='subject'>we</span> will deliver price stability in the medium term according to <span class='subject'>our</span> mandate. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on interventions, as you know. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on future markets. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have also learnt <span class='negation'>never</span> to <span class='comment'>talk</span> again about intervention until after the event. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the market itself. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market sentiment on a short-term or real-time basis. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such matters. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on markets on a day-to-day basis, first of all. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on policies that are pursued by other central banks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> said that everybody could <span class='comment'>expect</span> an increase of rates every meeting, every two meetings or every three meetings. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market behaviour in real time. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on surveys with questions on going back to this or that currency. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market observations in real time. </p>
<p>on your first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>, as you know, on moves on the market on a day-to-day basis or minute-by-minute basis. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what <span class='subject'>my</span> colleagues are saying. </p>
<p>first of all <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours or anonymous declarations. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in real time on market reactions. </p>
<p>as regards your second question: first of all, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours. </p>
<p>you could have asked a question on rumours about markets, exchange rates, etc. -- <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rates, but the exchange rate is certainly a very important element as far as growth and price stability are concerned, and <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly use it as one of the elements in <span class='subject'>our</span> economic assessment. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours. </p>
<p>at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> have to say that the ecb has <span class='negation'>never</span> called for new administrative codes and regulations, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are certainly calling for very active work in the various areas that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>, including the work to be done by the industry itself on a purely voluntary basis. </p>
<p>as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> have a separation principle, and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual institutions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>, as you know, on fed decisions either, which <span class='subject'>i</span> trust are excellent when taking into account all information that the federal reserve has. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'no (200)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p><span class='negation'>no</span> government, <span class='negation'>no</span> state can <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> special treatment from <span class='subject'>us</span>. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> am absolutely clear that the governing council has <span class='negation'>no</span> intention to signal <span class='negation'>any</span> change in the present interest rates, which <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> appropriate, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said on behalf of the governing council. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular commercial bank. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make on <span class='negation'>any</span> recent decisions. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what has been said by <span class='negation'>any</span> speaker. </p>
<p>but, in <span class='negation'>any</span> case <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> at this stage on <span class='negation'>any</span> new spectacular pan-european measures such as those you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have had absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> involvement in <span class='negation'>any</span> other cases in which the ecb has itself negotiated the recovery programme, made a judgement on the recovery programme, and <span class='comment'>told</span> the heads of state or government that they themselves had to invest in the form of bilateral loans. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'no (200)', 'beyond (9)'}</b></div><p>on <span class='subject'>our</span> securities markets programme, let <span class='subject'>me</span> only say that it is an ongoing programme and that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span> <span class='negation'>beyond</span> that. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'no (200)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>we</span> also were unanimous in communicating <span class='negation'>no</span> change to the forward guidance ; and also <span class='subject'>we</span> were unanimous in setting <span class='negation'>no</span> precise date for when to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> changes in the future. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> have given you a full and comprehensive view of what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today. </p>
<p>to <span class='negation'>no</span> extent, and that is the short <span class='comment'>answer</span> <span class='subject'>i</span> can give you. </p>
<p>at this stage <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> that the rule of the treaty must be respected fully in all circumstances. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>as for the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>responded</span> to it and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> to make. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> memory of having <span class='comment'>commented</span> in that way the dubai communiqu√©. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market expectations which would go against current expectations. </p>
<p>well, on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comment</span> on future decisions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this, apart from that <span class='subject'>we</span> say" <span class='negation'>no</span> '' to selective default. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make on your question of an attack on the euro. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>at this stage <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>as regards your first question <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on spreads. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> saw <span class='negation'>no</span> reason to <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> should modify the eurosystem staff projections which were published in december. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> to make. </p>
<p>as regards your question on the pressure from some euro zone governments <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>as regards your second questions on the securities market programme, <span class='subject'>we</span> have had <span class='negation'>no</span> discussions with anybody and have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the idea that you have floated. </p>
<p>on the exchange rates, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comments</span> than those <span class='subject'>i</span> have already made. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> have said, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span> to make on the second question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> news that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>comment</span> on. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can make <span class='negation'>no</span> forecast about how long <span class='subject'>we</span> will remain on that track, but <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> to be on it for a considerable time to come. </p>
<p>there is <span class='negation'>no</span> other central bank, <span class='subject'>we</span> are the only one -- <span class='subject'>i</span> draw your attention to that -- which immediately after having <span class='comment'>considered</span> the situation, and under the observation of the full body of european and global observers and journalists, produces its own assessment of the situation and asks the vice-president and the president to appear in front of you and to <span class='comment'>respond</span> as candidly as possible to the questions on the decision which has just been taken. </p>
<p>this is for the first time that <span class='subject'>i</span> give the <span class='comment'>answer</span> which <span class='subject'>i</span> announced <span class='subject'>i</span> would give already on 31 december 1998, that is" <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>remark</span> other than to say that what is very important in <span class='subject'>our</span> domain is qualification. </p>
<p>but let <span class='subject'>me</span> also say that <span class='negation'>no</span> action is being envisaged and <span class='negation'>no</span> policy has ever been <span class='comment'>discussed</span> by the governing council to this extent. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific reforms except to repeat that more needs to be done, especially on structural reforms, to continue the efforts that have already been made. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>well <span class='subject'>i</span> already <span class='comment'>answered</span> the first question in the sense that there was basically <span class='negation'>no</span> proposal to cut rates for the reasons that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>explained</span>, that <span class='subject'>our</span> decision last month was justified by facts and had produced exactly the desired outcomes. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>germany is now growing much more actively, which is a good thing, and <span class='subject'>i</span> am happy that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>no</span> longer have to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the usual questions <span class='subject'>i</span> faced during the first few years of <span class='subject'>my</span> mandate about germany being the sick man of the euro area ! </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> at this stage. </p>
<p>if there are <span class='negation'>no</span> new shocks, and with all other things being equal, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> inflation to fall below 2% in the course of this year, which would bring it into line with <span class='subject'>our</span> definition of price stability. </p>
<p>on your first question <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the smp. </p>
<p>as far as the psychological considerations are concerned, let <span class='subject'>me</span> first say that these are all hypothetical questions for which this old fox prefers to have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> promised on 31 december 1998 that <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>no</span> longer <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that issue. </p>
<p>as regards your third question <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on interest rates at zero. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, there was <span class='negation'>no</span> discussion, but <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>answered</span> the same question before. </p>
<p>and so <span class='subject'>we</span> are in fact revising <span class='subject'>our</span> communication about ela, because there 's absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> reason to keep things secret now, when <span class='subject'>we</span> 're <span class='comment'>addressing</span> a massive systemic problem, a macroeconomic problem. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span> matter who you <span class='comment'>talk</span> to, there are, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say, questions about the implementation, will and capacity. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are in a trough, that is absolutely clear, and progressively <span class='subject'>we</span> will see a gradual recovery. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that anything <span class='subject'>we</span> have that goes in the direction of an alleviation of this combined risk of oil prices, commodity prices and geopolitical risk would go in a good direction, but <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>with regard to your question on the instability in italy <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would say that provided it is a smooth and orderly evolution, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> reason to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comments</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> to make. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comments</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> that the situation was such that it was appropriate to decrease rates. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> will make <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the political situation. </p>
<p>at each of these meetings <span class='subject'>we</span> look at whether <span class='subject'>we</span> have to increase rates, decrease rates or leave rates unchanged, and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>as regards japan, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the policy pursued. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> other than to refer to what <span class='subject'>i</span> have just said on <span class='subject'>our</span> position. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what could be done in the case you <span class='comment'>mention</span> since it is the responsibility of the executive branches to reflect on this particular question. </p>
<p>on glass-steagall, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the united states. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make myself. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>we</span> are permanently reviewing <span class='subject'>our</span> policy, so <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that point. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have deliberately adopted a two-pillar strategy in which <span class='subject'>we</span> look at a broad range of other indicators - and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> quite a few to you today - which also determines <span class='subject'>our</span> attitude, together with the assessment of monetary developments. </p>
<p>as regards your third question on the collateral rules, <span class='subject'>i</span> said what <span class='subject'>i</span> was <span class='comment'>expecting</span>, taking into account the very convincing decisions taken by greece, and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>it is good to look at all ideas on possible initiatives, but <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> at this stage. </p>
<p>as regards the us dollar, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> than the usual <span class='comment'>comment</span>, according to which - to take the words of the us authorities - a dollar which is credible and strong vis-√†-vis the other major floating currencies is good for the us and for the rest of the world. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> information on that and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> it would be a very extraordinary, bad decision. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have said that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> to add. </p>
<p>as regards your first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rating agencies at this stage. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have already said that several times, so <span class='subject'>i</span> take it that there is <span class='negation'>no</span> point in <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> anything else. </p>
<p>as regard your second questions <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the monetary policies of other central banks </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on your question on rating agencies at this stage. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> say again, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said three months ago, that there should be <span class='negation'>no</span> interpretation in terms of the monetary policy stance of this gradual and timely unwinding of the non-conventional measures, and, as far as the monetary policy stance is concerned, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> it to be appropriate. </p>
<p>you already knew what that position was, and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on glass-steagall. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the decision <span class='subject'>we</span> will take next time. </p>
<p>on that question, as <span class='subject'>i</span> promised on 31 december 1998, <span class='subject'>i</span> will give <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>my</span> conclusion, <span class='subject'>i</span> have made very clear, is that <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comment</span> is to be <span class='comment'>expected</span> from <span class='subject'>me</span> either on that interview, or on interventions. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> such fears, because, on average, as <span class='subject'>i</span> just implicitly said in the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the previous question, <span class='subject'>our</span> expectations for euro area-wide growth are for a recovery in the course of this year and a further acceleration in the course of 2000, with growth percentages well over two percent. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that point. </p>
<p>on your second point, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>well, you see, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question because <span class='subject'>we</span> are actually looking at this operation right now -- the governing council and ecb staff are actually <span class='comment'>examining</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have always said that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other appreciation when <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>examine</span> the monetary policy than to make a synthesis out of all the information that is available and, of course, exchange rates are part of that available information. </p>
<p>so today 's interest rate move was in <span class='negation'>no</span> way influenced by developments in the exchange rate, except that past developments in both oil prices and exchange rates were longer and more protracted than <span class='subject'>we</span> had <span class='comment'>anticipated</span> earlier andthey do work their way through orthey threaten to work their way through, both of them, into domestic inflationary expectations. </p>
<p>as regards the rest, and the investigation taking place in italy, <span class='subject'>i</span> have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make. </p>
<p>on your first question, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span>, because basically, and this also holds for all the other possible questions on this issue, negotiations are proceeding at this point in time, so there is <span class='negation'>no</span> point in <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on different aspects of these negotiations and different proposals. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make on that issue concerning the greek banks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make on that. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on your last question as to what <span class='subject'>we</span> will decide. </p>
<p>but, in a system of floating exchange rates, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> other particular <span class='comment'>remarks</span> to make on exchange rates on top of what <span class='subject'>i</span> just said. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>commented</span> on exchange rates and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p>yes, as the president said, negative rates have been in place for quite some time and <span class='subject'>we</span> see a situation where <span class='negation'>no</span> one can <span class='comment'>talk</span> about, say, asset price bubbles in the euro area. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say: <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> figure that <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>consider</span> pertinent to disentangle the supply and demand constraints that <span class='subject'>i</span> was <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>. </p>
<p>on the collateral, let <span class='subject'>me</span> only say that the press communiqu√© you will receive in few minutes makes clear that" <span class='negation'>no</span> changes will be made to the current haircut schedule foreseen for central government debt instruments that are rated in the above-mentioned range '', namely bbb range that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, as far as the second question is concerned, <span class='subject'>we</span> 're really <span class='comment'>talking</span> about nuances. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your first question is <span class='negation'>no</span> and as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> already made all the <span class='comment'>comments</span> necessary. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what has happened in the various markets you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>of course, <span class='subject'>we</span> are analysing that but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nobody (3)', 'nothing (21)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>we</span> proved that <span class='subject'>we</span> were pragmatic -- <span class='negation'>nobody</span> could have <span class='comment'>expected</span> that <span class='subject'>our</span> balance sheet would double since july 2007 -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> exclude <span class='negation'>nothing</span> ex ante. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nobody (3)'}</b></div><p>finally," close to 2% '' <span class='comment'>clarifies</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> have done so far, what <span class='subject'>we</span> have had in mind so far and what <span class='subject'>we</span> will try to continue to achieve, and if the next four-and-a-half years are marked, as were the past four-and-a-half years, by inflation expectations of below 2%, in a range of 1.7% to 1.9%, <span class='subject'>i</span> think that this would be a result that perhaps <span class='negation'>nobody</span> would have <span class='comment'>expected</span> before the euro was introduced. </p>
<p>again, before the euro was set up <span class='negation'>nobody</span> was <span class='comment'>predicting</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> would be as credible as the most credible central banks. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'none (2)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> know that <span class='negation'>none</span> of <span class='subject'>us</span> will start departing from the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>none</span> of this was <span class='comment'>considered</span> at all likely before the intensification of the crisis that <span class='subject'>we</span> have experienced since mid-september and the beginning of october last year. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>and that 's an entirely different issue which <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> deal with here, but the natural place to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> these issues is the basel committee -- <span class='negation'>any</span> change to the treatment of government bonds will have to be agreed at a global level. </p>
<p>to the first question <span class='subject'>i</span> would say: <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> give you <span class='negation'>any</span> fear <span class='subject'>i</span> would say only that <span class='subject'>we</span> are observing that, for the reasons <span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> -- and particularly the three reasons <span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> -- <span class='subject'>we</span> are observing inflation which is -- as you know -- still over and above 2%, 2.1% in the euro area, which is a little bit over and above what <span class='subject'>we</span> thought would be the normal evolution a few months ago. </p>
<p>unfortunately, there are a large number of countries in excessive deficit, so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular country. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> also added the warning that for the next few months base effects will make it look as if inflation is hardly falling <span class='negation'>any</span> longer, so <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> big movements in inflation over the next few months. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> personally happen to think that in europe <span class='subject'>we</span> will see more definite signs already in the first half of this year, maybe towards the end of the first half of this year, but in <span class='negation'>any</span> other respect, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> changed <span class='subject'>our</span> assessment for a gradual recovery which might take -- and now <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='comment'>talking</span> for europe only -- the growth rate in the last part of this year up to the potential growth rate at an annualised rate. </p>
<p>as regards the deposit rate, <span class='subject'>i</span> think it would be fair to say that, at 0.25%, it is at an extremely low level, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> will make <span class='negation'>any</span> change to this level in the period to come. </p>
<p>something of the sort, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think it has <span class='negation'>any</span> relevance to the issues <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> yet <span class='comment'>discussed</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> coordinated action, but <span class='subject'>we</span> have periodic exchanges anyway. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span>, at this stage, that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to change, in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect, the present medium-term eurosystem staff projections that <span class='subject'>we</span> published a month ago. </p>
<p>that is something <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> further but that is <span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> figures. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular wage negotiations occurring here and there. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> embark on <span class='negation'>any</span> kind of" gossip '' in <span class='comment'>answering</span> the part of your question which relates to how <span class='subject'>we</span> should act in view of possible risks stemming from a slowing down of the global or us economy. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> certainly do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the day-to-day evolution of stock markets or the day-to-day evolution of <span class='negation'>any</span> market in particular. </p>
<p>and, <span class='subject'>i</span> hope you will excuse <span class='subject'>me</span>, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> give <span class='negation'>any</span> judgement on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular person and certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> on one of <span class='subject'>my</span> most outstanding colleagues, whom you just <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> will have <span class='negation'>any</span> difficulties at <span class='negation'>any</span> future meetings. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on what would happen if the commitments are <span class='negation'>not</span> met. </p>
<p>so until then <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think it would be appropriate for <span class='subject'>us</span> to make <span class='negation'>any</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> and <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about the outcome. </p>
<p>on your first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> give you -- and you do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>me</span> to -- <span class='negation'>any</span> precise date. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> acceleration of the pace of <span class='subject'>our</span> progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation if <span class='subject'>our</span> baseline scenario is confirmed. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> directly on <span class='negation'>any</span> individual banks, but what <span class='subject'>i</span> can say about what the portuguese authorities have done in this case, they certainly took swift action on that case. </p>
<p>and with regard to how seriously the outcome of the us elections will affect the foreign exchange markets, <span class='subject'>i</span> have heard from market participants so far - and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> better sources than that - that they <span class='comment'>expect</span> the effects - whatever the outcome will be - to be limited. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on the decision of <span class='negation'>any</span> individual country. </p>
<p>as to your other point, <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said everything that <span class='subject'>i</span> have to say about the future. </p>
<p>of course, there are people who -- one or two council members observed that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to think in perspective to the link between the asset purchase programme and the inflation convergence, so there were some few -- two, actually, if <span class='subject'>i</span> remember, two, <span class='subject'>i</span> guess -- observations of this nature, but there was <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> discussion like that on normalisation, as you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>so deflation risks are <span class='negation'>not</span> there <span class='negation'>any</span> longer, and that 's why <span class='subject'>we</span> have removed one of <span class='subject'>our</span> easing biases, which was exactly <span class='comment'>addressing</span> the tail risks of the inflation path. </p>
<p>if the vice-president wants to have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that <span class='subject'>i</span> will give him the floor, but otherwise <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual institutions, and as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> have the separation principle. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that, other than to say that, in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, the needle of <span class='subject'>our</span> compass is that <span class='subject'>we</span> make a judgement on what is necessary to counter inflationary risks at <span class='negation'>any</span> given moment. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> pre-committed in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the" august '' question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are free to do what <span class='subject'>we</span> would judge appropriate when the time comes, but at the present moment, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on probabilities. </p>
<p>they in <span class='negation'>any</span> case relate to the whole euro area, so <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about large figures. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> prospective or current change in interest rates. </p>
<p><span class='comment'>answering</span> the second question first, <span class='subject'>we</span> actually did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that to <span class='negation'>any</span> extent other than saying two things that <span class='subject'>i</span> can remember of <span class='subject'>our</span> very short discussion is that this fiscal expansion is pro-cyclical. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what the united states could do, or could <span class='negation'>not</span> do. </p>
<p>on the -- if <span class='negation'>any</span> -- reform proposals of the decision-making bodies of the ecb, <span class='subject'>we</span> are in the midst of the exercise ; <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>discussing</span> it intensively among the 18 members of the governing council and at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> really can <span class='negation'>not</span> say anything more than that. </p>
<p>so they did <span class='negation'>not</span> give <span class='negation'>any</span> reason - and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>explain</span> it in a minute - to change the overall figure. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> enter into <span class='negation'>any</span> speculation about who will be <span class='subject'>my</span> successor, as you can understand and as you undoubtedly <span class='comment'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this and, as usual, <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> commit to <span class='negation'>any</span> further measures. </p>
<p>frankly <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> banks ' behaviour to change dramatically in <span class='negation'>any</span> way. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> other non-standard measures. </p>
<p>first of all it is extremely important that the programme is applied, and <span class='subject'>i</span> shall <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on that. </p>
<p>first question -- <span class='subject'>we</span> will see what will be in <span class='subject'>our</span> next projections, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect the next projections -- they depend on a number of parameters and on the work that will be done by <span class='subject'>our</span> staff. </p>
<p>in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='subject'>our</span> own communication. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular declaration by colleagues. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think this reproach, if <span class='negation'>any</span>, comes a little late, because <span class='subject'>i</span> remember that when <span class='subject'>we</span> increased rates in december 2005, most of the economists were <span class='comment'>telling</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span>, that their economic analysis strongly recommended <span class='negation'>not</span> doing so. </p>
<p>incidentally, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> seen <span class='negation'>any</span> of the awful, terrible risks that were <span class='comment'>predicted</span> at the time. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular instrument that <span class='subject'>we</span> might have <span class='comment'>discussed</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are very flattered to be on your side and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on the glass-steagall act... </p>
<p>so, again, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> express anything on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular country but <span class='subject'>i</span> would say -- as it was <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> by ecofin -- that <span class='subject'>we</span> must have stable figures which are <span class='negation'>not</span> dependent on electoral or political cycles. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> prefer, also in this respect, <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about <span class='negation'>any</span> likely consequence or <span class='negation'>any</span> likely reaction to what <span class='subject'>we</span> know or what <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> know is going to happen. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> such possibility. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> give <span class='negation'>any</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have drawn <span class='subject'>my</span> conclusions and <span class='subject'>i</span> accept the advice and that is: <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>answer</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> questions related to that recent interview and, insofar as interventions are concerned, <span class='negation'>any</span> questions related to interventions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular measure. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> mechanistically <span class='comment'>react</span> to an exchange rate evolution, as <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> mechanistically <span class='comment'>react</span> to a fiscal position evolution or to <span class='negation'>any</span> other evolution, such as oil prices and so forth. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>remark</span> made by <span class='negation'>any</span> member of the commission, including mr solbes. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> other fashion on what <span class='subject'>we</span> in the governing council may do. </p>
<p>but do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> decision before, <span class='subject'>we</span> have engaged in preparing for the second series of banknotes to be put into circulation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span>, in <span class='negation'>any</span> event, <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='subject'>my</span> personal plans or on the position of president of the ecb, as <span class='subject'>i</span> had promised the press that <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> do so at <span class='negation'>any</span> time in the future. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that issue at <span class='negation'>any</span> other time, <span class='negation'>not</span> even on whether discussions have taken place. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular economy in europe, but it is obvious that some economies are behaving very properly. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> was referring to the domestic measures that the government has to take in order to continue the adjustment in the best fashion possible, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> other <span class='comment'>comments</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further on that. </p>
<p>she said that she fully supports <span class='subject'>our</span> independence and she did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>our</span> independence had been" polluted '' in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect. </p>
<p>and, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect that it will hamper <span class='subject'>our</span> attachment to the delivery of price stability in line with <span class='subject'>our</span> definition. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> see <span class='negation'>any</span> tendency towards creating a supranational supervisory body, nor a body encompassing all the financial activities you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the sphere of security settlement, banking and insurance. </p>
<p>do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> from <span class='subject'>me</span>. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> bold moves that may have been decided. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular instrument. </p>
<p>that being said <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> pre-committed in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect: <span class='subject'>we</span> will do whatever is necessary to take into account the situation as it will unfold progressively and to take into account the fact that, in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, <span class='subject'>we</span> have to be -- <span class='subject'>my</span> colleagues and myself in the governing council -- able, at <span class='negation'>any</span> time, to continue to <span class='comment'>tell</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens:" you can have confidence ; <span class='subject'>we</span> will deliver price stability in the medium term ''. </p>
<p>it is totally absurd and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to cite <span class='negation'>any</span> particular country, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will say one thing in the case of one country which <span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> as creating a problem. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the specific decisions or intentions of <span class='negation'>any</span> particular government. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> and <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span>, theorise or analyse about the size of <span class='negation'>any</span> change that was <span class='negation'>not</span> contemplated. </p>
<p>as regards inflation, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see that there 's <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further on the zero. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> qualify the absence or presence of the sentence that you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> as having <span class='negation'>any</span> meaning at this stage. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> believe <span class='subject'>i</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> that could be interpreted in <span class='negation'>any</span> way as influencing decisions. </p>
<p>in <span class='subject'>our</span> projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous variable, so <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>assume</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> change, strictly for - <span class='subject'>i</span> am almost inclined to say -" scientific reasons ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>explain</span> fully, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have said on many occasions, the level of the euro at <span class='negation'>any</span> particular moment. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> have decided on many occasions - and <span class='subject'>i</span> have stuck to that decision ever since - that <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further on this issue. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to pre-empt the result in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect, but the principles <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> are very strong, which calls, of course, for as thorough as deep and strict as possible an examination of what has happened. </p>
<p>yes, but <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> kind of shocks. </p>
<p>that being said, <span class='subject'>we</span> are doing what <span class='subject'>we</span> judge to be appropriate in order to cope with this situation and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> modification of the deposit rate. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the experience of <span class='negation'>any</span> particular council member. </p>
<p>and, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, every partner has to live up to its responsibility, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> kind of time-frame for this. </p>
<p>if it is a new thing, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect because <span class='subject'>we</span> have to look at it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> new figures compared with what <span class='subject'>we</span> had <span class='comment'>discussed</span> before. </p>
<p>on the precise amount, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> really make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>: first of all, because it is a decision of the member states ; and second, because it is a decision that has to be calibrated vis-√†-vis the eventual shortfalls that may come up. </p>
<p>this information was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>examined</span> by the governing council and <span class='subject'>i</span> would certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> draw <span class='negation'>any</span> general conclusions from it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have to say that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>examine</span> this situation and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> specific analysis that <span class='subject'>i</span> can refer to. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> really do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> to make about the next elections in the european parliament. </p>
<p>and if <span class='subject'>we</span> came to the judgement that the exchange rate developments are really seriously out of line with the economic fundamentals of the various large areas in the world - europe and the united states - then <span class='subject'>we</span> would probably <span class='comment'>react</span>, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that <span class='negation'>any</span> more than <span class='subject'>i</span> have done right now. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> for <span class='subject'>me</span> but for axel weber to <span class='comment'>explain</span> and <span class='subject'>i</span> am, in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, only quoting what he said to give you an overall understanding. </p>
<p>as regards what the united states might or might <span class='negation'>not</span> ask, <span class='subject'>we</span> will see when <span class='subject'>we</span> participate in the meeting, but again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect what <span class='subject'>we</span> will do, or what the british presidency will do, <span class='subject'>i</span> will only say that the present global consensus -- and it has been expressed several times before now -- is that <span class='subject'>we</span> all have homework to do. </p>
<p>so, that is an indication that you might have, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular provisioning of commercial banks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have said that the hump will be incorporated in <span class='subject'>our</span> forecast, <span class='subject'>i</span> would be very surprised if it were <span class='negation'>not</span> the case, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to embark on <span class='negation'>any</span> other <span class='comment'>remark</span> at this stage. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the statements of <span class='negation'>any</span> particular head of state or government. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> recent change in <span class='subject'>our</span> own analysis in this respect. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that, and in a sense it 's kind of -- it would test, <span class='subject'>i</span> think, <span class='subject'>our</span> credibility if <span class='subject'>we</span> were to change target when it 's taking more effort to achieve that target, so there has <span class='negation'>n't</span> been <span class='negation'>any</span> discussion about changing target of inflation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> make <span class='negation'>any</span> further <span class='comment'>comments</span> on the monetary policy of japan. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> other fashion. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see <span class='negation'>any</span> country 's debt as being unsustainable, so that 's one <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> just wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that ; it 's just too early. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on this <span class='negation'>any</span> further. </p>
<p>unfortunately <span class='subject'>i</span> have to disappoint you because <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> of this. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect on what the market is <span class='comment'>predicting</span> at a certain distance from now. </p>
<p>it has also been effective in reducing the sensitivity of money market rates to news that would <span class='negation'>not</span> warrant <span class='negation'>any</span> change in fundamentals or, in other words, the sensitivity of <span class='subject'>our</span> money market rates to news coming from the rest of the world of the kind <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> before. </p>
<p>it is important for price stability and growth and it certainly did <span class='negation'>n't</span> play <span class='negation'>any</span> role in today 's discussion and, as far as <span class='subject'>i</span> can remember, it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this in <span class='negation'>any</span> depth today, but there are a whole range of instruments that <span class='subject'>we</span> can activate, if needed. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> should repeat the very important message that <span class='subject'>we</span> are withdrawing all the liquidity that is injected in order to fully preserve the monetary policy stance, which <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> be changed and which <span class='subject'>we</span> have again today <span class='comment'>considered</span> does <span class='negation'>not</span> need <span class='negation'>any</span> change. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll quickly and readily <span class='comment'>answer</span> the second question immediately, saying that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> even want to contemplate that, and based on the greek government leaders ' statements, this option is <span class='negation'>not</span> contemplated by themselves as well, so <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> ready to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> possible situation like that. </p>
<p>as for the imf, oecd and other international institutions, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> at all on their figures, if <span class='negation'>any</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect on what <span class='subject'>we</span> could do next time. </p>
<p>the decision that has been taken is a step in the right direction and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> more on that. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> respect. </p>
<p>but again <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> of these particular dossiers. </p>
<p>but again, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular dossier and <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> either today 's financial times. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular dossier -- <span class='subject'>i</span> think you have in mind one particular dossier -- and it is <span class='subject'>our</span> previous constant position that the european rules of the single market have to be respected. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular dossier. </p>
<p>with regard to why <span class='subject'>we</span> think that zero interest rates would be very inconvenient, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further. </p>
<p>so while <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> indication that higher prices for some specific types of collateral are hampering the transmission of <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy, <span class='subject'>we</span> have nevertheless <span class='comment'>discussed</span> what the ecb could do, and <span class='subject'>i</span> just announced one of the things that will be detailed in the 3:30 p.m. announcement. </p>
<p>second, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that you have noted that <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> say the words" strong vigilance '', and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> further on that. </p>
<p>this is a remarkable result, <span class='negation'>not</span> only because <span class='subject'>we</span> did what <span class='subject'>we</span> had said <span class='subject'>we</span> would do -- in this domain, as in all others, as you know, what counts are facts and figures -- and demonstrated capacity to ensure price stability ; it is also remarkable because, with this record, <span class='subject'>we</span> would be in a better price stability situation than what has been observed in <span class='negation'>any</span> particular country in the euro area in either the 1990s or 1980s, <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span> the 1970s, which everybody knows was a period of very high inflation. </p>
<p>first of all, on the first question, the sequencing: <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> think there is <span class='negation'>any</span> need to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this now. </p>
<p>in <span class='negation'>any</span> case, it seems to <span class='subject'>me</span> that it is something which should be <span class='comment'>examined</span>, again, <span class='negation'>not</span> only in the european context, but also at the global level. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'beyond (9)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> say anything more, as the governing council has <span class='comment'>considered</span> that it is <span class='negation'>not</span> appropriate to go <span class='negation'>beyond</span> that. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'difficult (18)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>it 's very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to <span class='comment'>answer</span> about <span class='subject'>my</span> expectation of a market reaction following kind of a random statement made by somebody who did <span class='negation'>n't</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> clue or information about that. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'difficult (18)'}</b></div><p>now, it 's very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> to distinguish between these three sets of factors, sets of conditions, so <span class='subject'>we</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> exactly on what explanation is the most likely. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have forgotten that <span class='subject'>we</span> have had very <span class='negation'>difficult</span> episodes, <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span> the asian crisis, which was also very dramatic. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'no (200)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>but, certainly, these must be the two reasons: either they are fearful to lend -- and here <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about banks that do <span class='negation'>not</span> have capital constraints of course -- so, <span class='comment'>assuming</span> that they do <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='negation'>any</span> capital constraints, banks do <span class='negation'>not</span> lend because either the risk aversion is too high or because there is <span class='negation'>no</span> demand. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your first question is <span class='negation'>no</span>, meaning that <span class='subject'>we</span> had a brief discussion which was <span class='negation'>not</span> in <span class='negation'>any</span> great depth and did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>touch</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> technical aspect of this possible measure. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your second question is that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see <span class='negation'>any</span> prospect of that happening. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='negation'>any</span> particular meaning that the last sentence might have but it has <span class='negation'>no</span> other meaning besides what it says:" the governing council will monitor very closely all developments ''. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> specific move on interest rates but <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly <span class='comment'>discussed</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> general monetary policy stance, which <span class='subject'>we</span> found accommodative in view of an economic outlook that is becoming more uncertain. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that ; <span class='subject'>we</span> had absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> pre-commitment to <span class='negation'>any</span> particular non-standard measure. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p>well, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is: <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> changed <span class='subject'>our</span> diagnosis at the level of the euro area as a whole and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on one particular event. </p>
<p>your other question was about tapering: <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> really the scarcity issue because so far <span class='subject'>we</span> 've given plenty of evidence that whenever there were... by the way these problems, these doubts were present at the very beginning of <span class='subject'>our</span> programme. </p>
<p>with regard to the first question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> decreasing the rate on the deposit facility. </p>
<p>on you last question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> ready to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> had said" <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> move in the months to come because <span class='subject'>we</span> are alert and <span class='subject'>we</span> will do whatever is necessary to cope with risks and threats to price stability ''. </p>
<p>on the third question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have estimates of course but the range of these estimates is so wide that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want <span class='comment'>discuss</span> them now. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> scenarios of different impacts that the crisis could have. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this today in the governing council, but on one thing - on interest rates - <span class='subject'>i</span> would like to say that it is <span class='subject'>our</span> impression that the way in which long-term interest rates, in particular, have developed over the last few days can be interpreted as an indication that inflationary expectations of the market remain very, very subdued indeed and that there are thus <span class='negation'>no</span> expectations in the market of a change even in the longer term. </p>
<p>well, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is: <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p>first, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the declaration of the president of iceland, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> read it and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> usually <span class='comment'>comment</span> on declarations that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> read. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>well, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is, <span class='subject'>we</span> really -- <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it at all. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> composition. </p>
<p>at the present moment, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that in <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement <span class='subject'>we</span> have to revise the growth potential for the euro area upwards. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> covered bonds at all. </p>
<p>you are asking questions <span class='subject'>i</span> really can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>, <span class='negation'>not</span> only because <span class='subject'>we</span> only took note of this today, but also because these are really internal policy matters on which the president of the ecb has <span class='negation'>no</span> say. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that matter this morning. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, this time <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> say that <span class='subject'>we</span> 've <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the side effects and risks, but it 's a discussion that <span class='subject'>we</span> have ongoing anyway. </p>
<p>the default or selective default could be a consequence of some of the actions and then <span class='subject'>we</span> would say:" <span class='negation'>no</span>, it is <span class='negation'>not</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='comment'>consider</span> appropriate in the circumstances ''. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>talk</span> to leaders to ask for reassurances about what they plan to do. </p>
<p>second, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> indication that would change <span class='subject'>my</span> trust in the fact that the federal reserve chairman and the secretary of the treasury, <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span> the president of the united states, are <span class='negation'>not</span> playing the strategy or tactics of a weak dollar. </p>
<p>in <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your first question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> interest rate changes. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> response other than what has been indicated by the various projections that <span class='subject'>we</span> have available -- <span class='negation'>not</span> only the staff projections, which are published immediately after <span class='subject'>our</span> meeting today, but <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> the figures, and you can draw your own conclusions from those. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question is <span class='subject'>we</span> really have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> at all this and <span class='subject'>we</span> think the measures <span class='subject'>we</span> 've taken today are adequate to <span class='comment'>address</span> the change in underlying economic conditions since <span class='subject'>our</span> last monetary policy measures were taken. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comments</span> on it, because <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know the reasoning behind it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> see <span class='negation'>no</span> danger of deflation and, contrary to what you are suggesting, inflation is <span class='negation'>not</span> falling faster than <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> it to. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a day-to-day basis or a week-to-week basis, thus <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on real-time market reaction. </p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> are taking <span class='negation'>no</span> action at present, you can <span class='comment'>assume</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> perturbed by the present state and development of the exchange rate. </p>
<p>therefore <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on whether some survey indicators have peaked or <span class='negation'>not</span>. </p>
<p>on the g7 you know, because <span class='subject'>i</span> always say that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> myself in advance on the meeting of the g7, <span class='subject'>i</span> will have a press briefing after the meeting of the g7 in tokyo and then <span class='subject'>i</span> will say what <span class='subject'>we</span> will have <span class='comment'>discussed</span> and decided in terms of a communiqu√© wording, so, at this stage, <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> look at it, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about it in terms of concern or worry at this stage. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> say that <span class='negation'>no</span> other figures were <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>well, the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the bank of england 's decision. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> have a biennial review and that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>considered</span> since the very beginning of the turbulence that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> reason to change <span class='subject'>our</span> framework, so <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span>. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see a risk of scarcity, and <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> other measures. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> -- and there is <span class='negation'>no</span> reason to <span class='comment'>expect</span> -- a different monetary policy on the basis of the clarification of the strategy, which was decided on today. </p>
<p>that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> say for the future, but for now the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span>. </p>
<p>with regard to the first question, <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know them yet, so <span class='subject'>i</span> can do <span class='negation'>no</span> more than <span class='comment'>answer</span> your question in these vague terms, and certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> in quantitatively precise terms. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> refer to analytic work that would <span class='comment'>respond</span> to your question. </p>
<p>on the last question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this at the level of the governing council. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question is <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> changes. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> cutting the link, <span class='negation'>no</span>. </p>
<p>the first question 's <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> specific instruments, because you have to understand, <span class='subject'>we</span> spent several hours <span class='comment'>discussing</span> how to make the abs programme work. </p>
<p>so there was <span class='negation'>no</span> tapering and what <span class='subject'>we</span> 're going to do in the future was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> think so because the present legislation that is in place is being applied in all its details ; that 's the straight and true <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> do hear the noises, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know precisely what the credit to the private sector is being used for or where it goes, but <span class='subject'>we</span> see <span class='negation'>no</span> signs for the euro area as a whole of a credit crunch in the sense you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>on the first question the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is <span class='negation'>no</span> and on the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> either point. </p>
<p>now, on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> only <span class='comment'>remarked</span> it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> at all as a sign of the improved climate, so <span class='negation'>no</span> member of the governing council felt the need to even <span class='comment'>mention</span> this. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the reinvestment policy today. </p>
<p>on latvia, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this issue at all at this governing council meeting and so <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> particular <span class='comment'>comments</span> at this stage. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> either today. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'reluctant (3)'}</b></div><p>on the first issue, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before, <span class='subject'>i</span> really am <span class='negation'>reluctant</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on negotiations in which the ecb is <span class='negation'>not</span> a direct party and that are actually taking place at this point in time. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'without (15)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>with regard to those who fear for <span class='subject'>our</span> credibility, <span class='subject'>i</span> would draw their attention to the fact that, of the big central banks of the advanced economies in the world, <span class='subject'>we</span> are the only one that is taking a number of decisions that are <span class='negation'>not</span> generally <span class='comment'>considered</span> anodyne and <span class='negation'>not</span> generally <span class='comment'>considered</span> <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> element of credibility for the central banks taking such decisions. </p>
<p>as regards recent messages, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> quote <span class='negation'>any</span> particular currency, if you permit <span class='subject'>me</span>, but as you know, it was made very, very clear by both wim duisenberg here, and by colleagues in the united states that the communiqu√© which was sent from dubai was clear, <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> particular currency, that <span class='subject'>we</span> thought that some asian currencies could progressively, smoothly and orderly appreciate over time. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)', 'without (15)'}</b></div><p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> only say that what <span class='subject'>i</span> have seen coming from ireland has been quite impressive in terms of adjusting to new circumstances <span class='negation'>without</span> losing time and <span class='negation'>not</span> hesitating to take the kind of bold and courageous decisions <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in order to put the economy back on its feet. </p>
<p>as regards your question on the tax cuts: <span class='subject'>we</span> are transmitting <span class='subject'>our</span> message on fiscal policy very clearly to all countries of the euro area <span class='negation'>without</span> exception, including, of course, the particular country that you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> -- which, by the way, is <span class='negation'>not</span> necessarily in the worst situation as regards the figures. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> sit back and let these risks go by <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='comment'>reacting</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> undertake exercises <span class='negation'>without</span> having an <span class='comment'>answer</span> to what happens if <span class='subject'>we</span> identify capital shortfalls. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (1281)'}</b></div><p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> do anything but warmly welcome this outcome: it shows that the irish people <span class='comment'>consider</span> fiscal consolidation and fiscal stability to be a basic pillar for growth and further european integration. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'll <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the" here '' or the" there '', but they seem to be adding to the upside risks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the last question. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> at all on the first question. </p>
<p>these are monetary issues that have a market influence and <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on issues of that nature. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that ! </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> anything other than <span class='subject'>our</span> baseline scenario. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> only a monetary union, it is an economic and monetary union, which is one of the reasons why <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> so important the fiscal side of the coin and on the stability and growth pact. </p>
<p>on this very important question, which is the constitution, <span class='subject'>we</span> all rely very much on the wisdom of the irish presidency, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the details of what the irish presidency is preparing. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> saying <span class='subject'>we</span> have a fragile banking system, but it is very important to <span class='comment'>address</span> this concern and to avoid a credit crunch. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> again on that issue because <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> am giving a status to these projections that would <span class='negation'>not</span> necessarily be the real appropriate status that they have in <span class='subject'>our</span> own monetary policy strategy. </p>
<p>of course, that does <span class='negation'>not</span> mean that you do <span class='negation'>n't</span> have a number of other factors that are going in the other direction, particularly due to the financial turmoil and all the financial difficulties <span class='subject'>i</span> have been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>. </p>
<p>one is the long-term greater health of the banking system -- when <span class='subject'>i</span> say long-term, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about years, but about the end of this year, when the aqr will have been completed. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> view now movements in interest rates as a realistic way to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to risks in financial stability that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> see. </p>
<p>this is very important and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on this because it is the fundamental message that <span class='subject'>we</span> give. </p>
<p>as regards your first question it is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>my</span> habit to <span class='comment'>comment</span> either on a second-by-second basis or on a day-by-day basis. </p>
<p>there are permanent changes in the market, so <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such things. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would rather <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the second question. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> have said, this is a fully effective backstop removing tail risk for europe, and <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on other measures for the time being at least. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would, by the way, disagree that the other two programmes have <span class='negation'>not</span> worked in such a kind of decisive way, but let <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>talk</span> about the present programme. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> at all the last point that you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a number of other issues. </p>
<p>on your first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this option. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> anything like default or such a default procedure at all. </p>
<p>on the sovereign bonds, <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the point. </p>
<p>often elections have an impact on the economy, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the specifics of this election. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>extrapolate</span> too much from this repayment pattern, saying that in a month 's time this figure of $ 250 billion would go down to $ 200 billion, or whatever. </p>
<p>the other note of caution that <span class='subject'>i</span> would sound is that one should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>extrapolate</span> too much from the past repayment pattern of ltros. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the last question because <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on what the" appropriate level '' is for the euro in a world that is ever-changing. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p>well, mr. noyer has participated in the discussion about italy, and <span class='subject'>i</span> am sure that he will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you anything about their discussion, despite the leaks that have come out of brussels. </p>
<p>on the interest rate moves of other countries, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>, with the exception that, as the danish governor <span class='comment'>told</span> <span class='subject'>me</span>, truly, it has become possible for the danes to lower their official rates partly as a result of the successful launch of the euro. </p>
<p>so, all in all, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about a process - <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to give the idea that <span class='subject'>we</span> have a precise figure in mind - but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about a process which, to <span class='subject'>my</span> mind, will take at least a decade to be fully completed. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am sorry, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the specific italian situation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it today, but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it many times before. </p>
<p>on the ncbs, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> really have a deep discussion about that issue, but <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it and <span class='subject'>we</span> basically have <span class='negation'>not</span> reached a conclusion yet. </p>
<p>part of what is happening is a necessary adjustment, because let <span class='subject'>us</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> forget that the imbalances that initially needed to be <span class='comment'>addressed</span> by greek economic policy were really very important. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have all always said that <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> governments what to do when it comes to the omt. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>answer</span> this question as you can imagine. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> really <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the report as such, because it is a process, it is coming out, it is in the making -- it still can be modified by further discussions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it anyway. </p>
<p>well, the response to the first question is <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> tapering last time. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> tapering this time, by the way. </p>
<p>or <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> even <span class='comment'>discuss</span> high-class problems of the kind that <span class='subject'>i</span> was asked before. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> frankly do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that explicitly. </p>
<p>so do <span class='negation'>not</span> over interpret the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> this particular point in the communiqu√©. </p>
<p>unfortunately on neither ; <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on either of the two questions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> really want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific countries, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can give you the names of the leaders. </p>
<p>so, even though the ecb is depicted as the institution that is actually keeping rates low, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about the same rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market reactions, but let <span class='subject'>me</span> give you the bottom line of <span class='subject'>our</span> exchanges: basically, inflation is <span class='negation'>not</span> where <span class='subject'>we</span> want it to be, and where it should be. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question is <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sorry, but the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that, and to the first as well. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to do in view of september, or even less so what <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to do after september. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that but, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>we</span> gave you enough evidence that it was the case all the time that when the governing council needed flexibility to carry through its monetary policy it was successful in finding it. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> actually <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this, <span class='negation'>not</span> this time, but on other occasions <span class='subject'>we</span> briefly <span class='comment'>touched</span> upon it. </p>
<p>well <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> like to engage in speculation, is the president 's <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> ask <span class='subject'>my</span> colleague, dani√®le nouy, to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>second, regarding the remarkable capacity of the governing council of the ecb to take decisions that are <span class='negation'>not</span> usual and to do that rapidly, <span class='subject'>i</span> can illustrate that in the case of greece, with the three elements that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>, namely the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> called for an additional, major recovery programme, the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> were involved and made a judgement ourselves on this programme, and the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> confirmed to governments that in <span class='subject'>our</span> opinion they should step in. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> said at the time, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on politicians ' statements about <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have anything specific in mind that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>discuss</span> today, but this is certainly an issue that is very close to the governing council 's heart -- if <span class='subject'>i</span> can use that word in relation to central bankers. </p>
<p>you are asking questions <span class='subject'>i</span> really ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>ministers committed to <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on that and so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> be the first to violate this commitment. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> repeat <span class='subject'>my</span> statement about fruitless chatter ; that was the other part, if you were just hinting that <span class='subject'>i</span> should <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other people 's statements on the exchange rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> trade. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> these questions. </p>
<p>as you can imagine, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the first question. </p>
<p>as regards the mros after the first quarter <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> which way <span class='subject'>we</span> will proceed. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the ratings. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> myself on absurd hypotheses, so that would be <span class='subject'>my</span> response. </p>
<p>as regards vigilance, <span class='subject'>i</span> already <span class='comment'>responded</span> clearly and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>you would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> him to apply for credit, and that 's where the example <span class='comment'>tells</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> need structural reforms as well. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> too much on what <span class='subject'>we</span> have been observing in one particular, very important euro area economy recently because what counts for <span class='subject'>us</span> is the full body of the euro area. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about the 30s. </p>
<p>well, let <span class='subject'>me</span> first say that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span>, by and large, <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the nationalisation of banks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>but then, as <span class='subject'>i</span> did in <span class='subject'>my</span> introductory statement, <span class='subject'>i</span> paid considerable attention to monetary developments and <span class='subject'>i</span> extensively <span class='comment'>explained</span> why <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> the very dynamic monetary developments -- as <span class='subject'>we</span> see them -- as a threat that inflation might again be on its way up. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the issuer limit, and <span class='subject'>our</span> decision to change the issue limit is simply to ensure the smooth implementation of the current programme. </p>
<p>certainly, the price of oil, the price of commodities -- which <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> explicitly in <span class='subject'>our</span> communiqu√© -- all elements that <span class='subject'>we</span> can observe at the global level, including what has been observed in emerging asia and so forth, as well, of course, as the constellation of exchange rates: <span class='subject'>we</span> take all of this into account when <span class='subject'>we</span> make <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement. </p>
<p>as far as asset prices are concerned, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> the point in this communiqu√©. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>since, as you know, the strategy has <span class='negation'>not</span> changed but merely been <span class='comment'>clarified</span>, this decision would also have been taken had <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> made this clarification public. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> trust the lucidity of observers, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on their immediate reaction. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> do otherwise, because if <span class='subject'>we</span> were acting in a different scheme, in a different concept, then <span class='subject'>we</span> would suggest to those lucid observers and market participants that have been <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> that they can unanchor <span class='subject'>our</span> inflation expectations, because <span class='subject'>we</span> would be introducing other considerations than this solid anchoring of inflation expectations which is based on <span class='subject'>our</span> determination to deliver price stability in the medium term. </p>
<p>and when you ask it, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>" what if? '' </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> understand the relationship you <span class='comment'>mention</span>. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>we</span> will do whatever is necessary and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on future decisions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> sure <span class='subject'>i</span> get the logic of the second question, but <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll try to <span class='comment'>answer</span> that anyway. </p>
<p>on the second point, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> all instruments, but frankly <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> buying equity. </p>
<p>if sales did take place, they should <span class='negation'>not</span> change what <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>told</span> the market with <span class='subject'>our</span> own gold agreement. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>on the other point, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p>and the <span class='comment'>answer</span> is, to the extent and only to the extent that -- <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>react</span> to political uncertainty by itself, but <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly internalise the information that comes from the fact that political uncertainty may affect <span class='subject'>our</span> medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have sufficient evidence to <span class='comment'>answer</span> this question. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that the second point was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, but it 's in a sense part of your first question. </p>
<p>sometimes it 's also important to say what <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span>, and <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> tapering or the intended horizon -- and here comes the second question -- of <span class='subject'>our</span> asset purchase programme. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sorry to say, but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really <span class='comment'>touched</span> on the issue at all. </p>
<p>about the expectation, what 's going to be in the agenda for the december meeting, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really yet <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that at all. </p>
<p>in <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question: <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> anything like that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on the second quarter or the third quarter of this year. </p>
<p>and to use a word which <span class='subject'>i</span> have used in the past, namely" contagion '' -- by the way, <span class='subject'>i</span> saw it was misinterpreted, <span class='subject'>i</span> meant contagion between financial markets, and <span class='negation'>not</span> positive contagion from the financial markets to the real economy where <span class='subject'>i</span> have been always careful in <span class='comment'>explaining</span> that it is actually lagging -- you have seen, certainly, that the contagion to other countries has been muted this time, contrary to what might have happened about a year and a half ago, and this is another positive sign. </p>
<p>you will <span class='negation'>not</span> be surprised if <span class='subject'>i</span> say that <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> give an <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on the exchange rate. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know what financial markets will <span class='comment'>expect</span>, but <span class='subject'>we</span> think with this move <span class='subject'>we</span> have cleared the horizon, although it may be a moving horizon. </p>
<p>if it does <span class='negation'>not</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> am sorry, you will have to wait another week, unless you ask <span class='subject'>me</span> more precise questions that <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll forget to <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>on the first question: <span class='negation'>not</span> knowing what the neutral rate is, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the question whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>we</span> are still accommodative. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talk</span> about currencies in terms of yo-yos. </p>
<p>in <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talk</span> about intervention today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the market pricing-in future decisions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> say regularly when <span class='subject'>i</span> am asked more direct questions that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on absurd hypotheses. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in advance. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific statements by important politicians. </p>
<p>it will have an impact if it perseveres, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> sure that it will and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> it to persevere. </p>
<p>in a sense, it 's <span class='negation'>not</span> a question you should <span class='comment'>address</span> to <span class='subject'>me</span> but to the leaders, because it 's a political question. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span>, of course, all the figures that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the past, namely stock prices, namely spreads, spreads between -- <span class='subject'>we</span> can say the fragmentation in the eurozone is by and large over - so spreads between core countries and periphery bank lending is over ; spreads between corporates and smes have narrowed down a lot. </p>
<p>and, frankly, on the other part of your question and your colleague 's question, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that, at this point in time, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> really <span class='comment'>elaborating</span> on various non-standard situations in which <span class='subject'>we</span> may find ourselves. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> was saying, <span class='subject'>we</span> still have all <span class='subject'>our</span> tools to continue to pursue <span class='subject'>our</span> objectives within <span class='subject'>our</span> mandate and, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on further non-standard measures at this point in time. </p>
<p>taking all this into account, <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement was that the overall situation, from <span class='subject'>our</span> standpoint, had <span class='negation'>not</span> substantially changed, and that <span class='comment'>explains</span> why <span class='subject'>we</span> made the diagnosis that <span class='subject'>we</span> had to keep rates unchanged. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> like to <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on their entry into the erm and then afterwards perhaps the euro. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> in detail the preparation of the g7 meeting. </p>
<p>in fact, it should <span class='negation'>n't</span> be so, but let <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>explain</span> how <span class='subject'>we</span> reached the percentage of 20%, and what is the reasoning behind this decision. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> just do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span>, giving horizons of dates, of deadlines. </p>
<p>it depends on many parameters, and at this point, certainly <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on precise deadlines. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> sure <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> that. </p>
<p>the second question is easy to <span class='comment'>answer</span>: <span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific banking institutions. </p>
<p>banks have raised capital and substantially reduced their leverage, which is <span class='negation'>not</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expected</span> three or four years ago. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you what <span class='subject'>we</span> will do next month or in two months ' time, or in six months exactly, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will say that all the groundwork for venturing into negative territory for the interest rate on the deposit facility has been done. </p>
<p>whether this will be combined with other measures or <span class='negation'>not</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> in a position to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you now. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you this now. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> say <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> it a risk, as you said, but certainly it has to be <span class='comment'>addressed</span>. </p>
<p>on your third point, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the liquidity framework at today 's governing council meeting. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about what <span class='subject'>we</span> would do if there really were a recession. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about a potential recession if <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> see one coming. </p>
<p>so, it being only one of a wide range, a broad range of indicators, and the relationship being a loose one, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> give a precise <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the question as to what precisely the impact will be in the future. </p>
<p>the solution to that problem has to be found in measures of a convincingly reformist nature in the labour and in the goods markets and <span class='subject'>we</span> do hope that taking the monetary policy stance <span class='subject'>we</span> have taken today will in the ensuing months increasingly focus the attention of policy-makers and the public on the real causes of the unemployment problem, because it will demonstrably become clear that monetary policy is <span class='negation'>not</span> the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to solve those problems. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>addressed</span> yet other types of formal guidance as other central banks have done, and <span class='subject'>we</span> are reflecting on it. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> would rather <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> again because <span class='subject'>i</span> did that already in the past on the impact of vat and the speeding-up of consumption before the impact of vat and then the slowing-down. </p>
<p>well, the decision taken on 17 september 2001 certainly does <span class='negation'>not</span> bear witness to your claim that <span class='subject'>we</span> are slow in <span class='comment'>reacting</span> and resistant to change. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> believe that this is the most likely event and, therefore, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> this course of the growth rate of m3 as a source of future inflationary pressures. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> or take questions on developments in individual euro area countries. </p>
<p>so, you should <span class='negation'>not</span> deduce from the fact that <span class='subject'>our</span> projections were below but close to 2% in the medium term, at least in this horizon, that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> need to increase rates simply because such increases, as <span class='comment'>anticipated</span> by the markets, were incorporated in this projection. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual countries, <span class='negation'>not</span> even germany. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> have to go back to mr atkins because <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to part of his question, if you permit. </p>
<p>at the same time <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>told</span> you that <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> fall into what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> to be a possible liquidity trap, which is something that <span class='subject'>we</span> would deem dangerous for <span class='subject'>our</span> own economy, taking into account <span class='subject'>our</span> own circumstances, and that <span class='subject'>we</span> also have other means, other ways, if necessary, of embarking on" non-standard action ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this in the governing council, so that is <span class='subject'>my</span> personal view. </p>
<p>on your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what is said by colleagues. </p>
<p>and fairly unusually for <span class='subject'>me</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> will also <span class='comment'>tell</span> you why <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that -- because <span class='subject'>we</span> have to have non-standard measures which are effective, and they have to be effective in an area which is fragmented. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>n't</span> discount another fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> been <span class='comment'>discussing</span> so far: that there are a series of factors coming into play in the years ahead which tend to reduce the excess liquidity. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what will be done. </p>
<p>as regards the currency situation, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that you can compare the yen, one of the major currencies of the advanced economy, to the swiss franc. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> yet received a fully fledged analysis of it, so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> yet on this point. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> note that this is <span class='negation'>not</span> at all what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this morning. </p>
<p>this is <span class='negation'>not</span> to say that <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to your question ; <span class='subject'>i</span> only note that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it this morning. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> take for likely, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> recall exactly, that it was a <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the last observations of the last quarter of last year and there, again, <span class='subject'>we</span> have to remain a little bit cautious on how to interpret what has been observed, in particular in germany. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the decision taken today by the parliament in rome. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am sorry, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the second question because <span class='subject'>we</span> have always said that <span class='subject'>our</span> non-standard measures are temporary and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to pre-commit with regard to future decisions. </p>
<p>the size and the complexity of these two ltros are such that <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> to see immediate action, and especially as far as the transmission of the ltros into higher credit flows goes. </p>
<p>so, in a sense, <span class='subject'>we</span> can now say that this measure is <span class='comment'>addressed</span> to the whole of the euro area, it is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>addressed</span> to specific countries. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an <span class='comment'>answer</span> on the esm. </p>
<p>but would this mean that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>talk</span> to <span class='subject'>our</span> colleagues? </p>
<p>as regards this particular point, the staff rules state that the normal way to organise dialogue with the management of the bank, if <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> mistaken -- although <span class='subject'>i</span> am speaking on a matter that is under the control of lucas, who will <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this -- is through the staff committee. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussing</span> this in the governing council at the moment. </p>
<p>-lsb- asked to <span class='comment'>address</span> second question on extension of qe -rsb- that 's what <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm saying: <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p>so do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>i</span> am giving good marks and bad marks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> like to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on declarations or text that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> read. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the future. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'll <span class='comment'>tell</span> you what happened today: it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span>. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> particularly on short-selling. </p>
<p>it was to take into account all eventualities, and <span class='negation'>not</span> only all the other factors <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>, but also the indirect taxation increases and administrative price increases that are needed in order to bring the fiscal position back in line. </p>
<p>what <span class='subject'>we</span> see is more or less what <span class='subject'>we</span> had in mind and <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> too much disappointed because <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> extraordinary dynamic growth to be very likely. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think what <span class='subject'>we</span> are doing at the level of the governing council of the ecb with the securities markets programme has been made absolutely clear, and <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on spreads, just as <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a day-to-day basis on the level of stocks and shares. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> have always said that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> the interest rate level and the monetary policy stance, on the one hand, and the non-standard measures, on the other hand, to be moving" in sync ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know whether, and if, the french and german governments have <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this matter. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure, because the money market term structure has <span class='comment'>reacted</span> very well. </p>
<p>so, in may 2003, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>clarified</span> that that was <span class='negation'>not</span> the case, so the definition was <span class='comment'>clarified</span> as" below, but close to, 2% '' for the reasons that the president gave in one of his <span class='comment'>answers</span>. </p>
<p>if <span class='subject'>i</span> could, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> that, and on the exchange rates, which are, as you know, a very important issue, <span class='subject'>my</span> terms of reference are very simple. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p>whatever the <span class='comment'>remarks</span> made, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> them -- the conclusion was that <span class='subject'>we</span> had to apply the treaty as it stands. </p>
<p>the issue is disputed, you have several schools, but there is a broad agreement that this under-appreciation of risks can <span class='negation'>not</span> last forever, and that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to pave the way for an orderly adjustment of this situation at the global level, which might <span class='comment'>explain</span> why real rates are low, spreads are low, insurance premia are low, volatility is relatively low, all this in historical terms, of course. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> a prophet and <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>predict</span> precisely when. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> must say <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> see the message that you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> be surprised - on the contrary, to the extent that oil price and exchange rate developments work their way through in the coming months, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='comment'>expect</span>, for a brief period in the coming months, that the figure might even slightly exceed that of 2%, before dropping back to 2% or less, so that, on average, <span class='subject'>we</span> are somewhat less comfortable than the commission seems to feel. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual countries here. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> 've seen that the probability mass of risks has shifted upward, although it 's <span class='negation'>not</span> a dramatic effect at all, and then <span class='subject'>we</span> will be in a better position to <span class='comment'>answer</span> your question. </p>
<p>you know <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> directly on exchange rates. </p>
<p>first, on the structure of the organisation and the institutional process: <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> aware of what was <span class='comment'>discussed</span> because <span class='subject'>i</span> was <span class='negation'>not</span> there. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the assessment of the economy and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the broad macroeconomic projections, but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> anything else. </p>
<p>the position of the ecb, which you reflected very well, is that this is <span class='negation'>not</span> something that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> urgent or even appropriate in <span class='subject'>our</span> present situation. </p>
<p>unfortunately, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on either of the questions, because stopping this process is very much a decision that is entirely in the hands of governments. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> either, so <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the first question other than to say that <span class='subject'>we</span> 've <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> them. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> positively to the first question. </p>
<p>let 's say <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> whether to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it yet or <span class='negation'>not</span>. </p>
<p>so it 's just <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the second point. </p>
<p>on the first issue, <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm really <span class='comment'>commenting</span> only on monetary policy, and as <span class='subject'>we</span> said in the last part of the introductory statement, monetary policy should <span class='negation'>n't</span> be the only game in town, but this can be viewed in a variety of ways, one of which is the way in which <span class='subject'>our</span> colleague actually explored in <span class='comment'>examining</span> the situation, but there are other ways. </p>
<p>on the interest rate on the deposit facility, <span class='subject'>i</span> said before -- <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> know whether it was the last meeting or the meeting before that when <span class='subject'>i</span> was asked whether it was <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> had said it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span>. </p>
<p>there were a few who were <span class='negation'>not</span> very inclined to do something about the rate - but here <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>talk</span> about a very few - and a very large majority was inclined to do something and supported the proposal as <span class='subject'>we</span> put it before the council. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> just ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm saying this <span class='negation'>not</span> because <span class='subject'>i</span> want to avoid the <span class='comment'>answer</span>, but because <span class='subject'>i</span> think he 's the most fully qualified for <span class='comment'>answering</span> this question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the exchange rates. </p>
<p>now, on the reinvestment, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sorry, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that at all so <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> this question now. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> see similar changes in the profile for next year, and, all things <span class='comment'>considered</span>, including the profile and the carry-over, <span class='subject'>we</span> have this slight revision down. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> actually have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> anything about reinvestment policy, but you can have another question if you want. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it even when to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said from today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of <span class='subject'>our</span> measures to growth and inflation, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on us monetary policy. </p>
<p>now, on the other point, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>my</span> understanding of this is that whatever arrangement could be found, it is <span class='negation'>not</span> clear yet which specific area would be <span class='comment'>addressed</span> by this arrangement. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> know enough about the specificities of this statement to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more than that ; perhaps <span class='subject'>i</span> will know more tonight. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on nout. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> seen yet how these better prospects have translated and the reason why <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> seen <span class='subject'>i</span> 've <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> it before. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> questions on voting. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on one particular prior indication that the fourth quarter in one particular country might have been different from what was <span class='comment'>expected</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on future changes in interest rates. </p>
<p>but to <span class='comment'>answer</span> your second question, while <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual positions, of course, <span class='subject'>i</span> can say that the discussion was very constructive across the board. </p>
<p>but the precise modalities for the eligibility of these bonds has <span class='negation'>not</span> been decided yet, so that <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> able to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you whether this would be acceptable or <span class='negation'>not</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'll <span class='comment'>answer</span> the second question, because the first question has a quick <span class='comment'>answer</span> ; <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p>within this framework, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the introduction of thresholds or quantitative benchmarks. </p>
<p>it does <span class='negation'>not</span> say" it is <span class='comment'>expected</span> '' and it does <span class='negation'>not</span> say" an international institution <span class='comment'>expects</span> '' ; it says" <span class='subject'>we</span> -- the policy-makers -- <span class='comment'>expect</span> the key ecb interest rates to remain at the present or lower levels for an extended period of time ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on italy, but more generally <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that in some countries, for example greece, there was a labour market reform, bank recapitalisation, fiscal consolidation, and the same thing in ireland and portugal. </p>
<p>whether sudden stop becomes an extension of the programme or becomes tapering, that 's what you want to know ; <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that either. </p>
<p>as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> look at the euro area as a whole, so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a country. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on slight changes that <span class='subject'>we</span> might observe when <span class='subject'>we</span> extract information from markets as it is <span class='negation'>not</span> really pertinent. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> usually do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the functioning of <span class='subject'>our</span> democracies. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='subject'>our</span> democracies ' procedures. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have done a lot of hard work, but a lot of very hard work remains to be done, and it would be an enormous mistake to <span class='comment'>consider</span> that it is now business as usual, that with the recovery <span class='subject'>we</span> can be again tranquil and <span class='negation'>not</span> do the hard work <span class='subject'>i</span> 've been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>. </p>
<p>on your first point, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> envisage at all the solution that you have been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>, and, as far as <span class='subject'>we</span> are concerned, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> have in <span class='subject'>our</span> framework all the instruments that are necessary. </p>
<p>first of all, the interesting thing is that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> monetary policy per se. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question is <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>well, the reason why <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> monetary policy per se is that the reading of the current developments since the beginning of the year is actually very important in deciding the next steps. </p>
<p>you will <span class='negation'>not</span> be surprised when <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that the meeting today was a meeting at which <span class='subject'>we</span> have come to <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement, as always, on the basis of a very thorough examination of all arguments, looking in all directions, but <span class='subject'>we</span> were unanimous in coming to the decision <span class='subject'>we</span> took today. </p>
<p>this puts <span class='subject'>us</span> in a situation where the hump will probably be a little bit longer, and certainly bigger in terms of absolute magnitude, than what <span class='subject'>we</span> would have had, had <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> had to incorporate the two elements that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>on growth, <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said that <span class='subject'>our</span> baseline scenario has, at this stage, <span class='negation'>not</span> been modified significantly ; <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> would be around potential. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that this inertia of inflation over the next months -- and" next months '' might in fact mean several months -- is, as you have suggested, due to factors that would <span class='negation'>not</span> necessarily be there were a certain period of time to elapse, and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that over the longer run <span class='subject'>we</span> are in line with <span class='subject'>our</span> definition of price stability. </p>
<p>as regards the growth differential between the united states and europe, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on that. </p>
<p>if there were different opinions in the council, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you about it. </p>
<p>and one of the reasons why <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expected</span> a serious pick-up in credit for a while is that there is a lagged relationship between credit flows and the business cycle 's recovery, and that 's certainly something <span class='subject'>we</span> want to have <span class='subject'>our</span> eyes on in the coming weeks and, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say, the coming months too. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> 've said many times, the exchange rate is <span class='negation'>not</span> a policy target but it 's a serious concern for <span class='subject'>our</span> objective of price stability and therefore this concern will have to be <span class='comment'>addressed</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> believe that when things are said that are, in <span class='subject'>my</span> opinion, important and excellent, why <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> them? </p>
<p>each of <span class='subject'>us</span> has <span class='subject'>our</span> own mandate and responsibility, and <span class='subject'>i</span> have to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that all the g7 meetings <span class='subject'>i</span> have participated in, including when <span class='subject'>i</span> was <span class='negation'>not</span> president of the ecb but rather observing what was being <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, have proved to be very efficient in terms of interaction between the various participants, including the president of the european union and the president of the ecb -- <span class='subject'>my</span> predecessor as well as myself. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on the euro/dollar relationship than <span class='subject'>i</span> have already done. </p>
<p>so, <span class='negation'>not</span> only did <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it but <span class='subject'>we</span> took a decision. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on figures that are produced on a monthly basis. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it. </p>
<p>on the first point, that 's what <span class='subject'>i</span> meant when <span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more when <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>answered</span> before because <span class='subject'>we</span> are consulting with the rest of the governing council. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on measures taken by other monetary institutions. </p>
<p>the medium-term forward interest rates have been fairly well anchored and stable at the levels that <span class='subject'>we</span> wanted, even though the period over the last three, four, five months has seen a substantial -- <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> say volatility -- but certainly numerous actions by other jurisdictions, both on the monetary policy front and also, if you <span class='comment'>consider</span> the volatility that has characterised the emerging market economies, exchange rates and interest rates. </p>
<p>last month <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> qe explicitly, which <span class='comment'>explains</span> why <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it this month. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> policy measures for the effect they might have on the exchange rate ; that is going to be determined by the marketplace. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> should also add that this does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>explain</span> the whole of the difference. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about huge differences: the reasons that <span class='subject'>i</span> gave you before <span class='comment'>explain</span> the greatest part, but <span class='negation'>not</span> 100%, of the difference with the previous month. </p>
<p>you have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> the collateral issue but it is, of course, part of the interaction <span class='subject'>we</span> have with the money market. </p>
<p>as for the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> really <span class='comment'>comment</span> on mr bini smaghi 's views and <span class='subject'>i</span> really do <span class='negation'>not</span> know what a tailor-made quantitative easing for the euro area could be. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> myself do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours or leaks that are <span class='negation'>not</span> confirmed. </p>
<p>so, do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>assume</span> anything, but see it as a reminder of the terms of reference that <span class='subject'>i</span> have for this particular issue. </p>
<p>well, again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the day-to-day evolution. </p>
<p>as far as your second question is concerned, <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> really <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>in <span class='comment'>answer</span> to your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other people 's statements, because there are so many made about the ecb between one governing council meeting to another that <span class='subject'>we</span> would basically spend the whole time <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on them. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> remain very prudent and cautious and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the question on the average of next year. </p>
<p>it is also clear that <span class='subject'>we</span> are observing in certain economies, <span class='negation'>not</span> in all economies and certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> in <span class='subject'>our</span> economy as a whole, a phenomenon of asset inflation in the real estate sector which has to be <span class='comment'>examined</span> very carefully. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> it announces anything else, you might ask the governor of the bank of china and the chinese authorities. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would only say and confirm that there is a consensus in the g7 communiqu√© to signal that some currencies -- <span class='negation'>not</span> the particular currency that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about here, i.e. the chinese currency, but a number of currencies in asia -- could certainly be allowed to appreciate, to some extent, by market forces, in a progressive, orderly and smooth fashion, which is <span class='negation'>not</span> the case today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to challenge what they <span class='comment'>consider</span> acceptable one-off measures even if <span class='subject'>we</span> know, and <span class='subject'>we</span> always make the point very clearly, that the fact that they are <span class='negation'>not</span> recurrent creates a problem of continuity for the future years. </p>
<p>but again, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> challenge what is <span class='comment'>considered</span> legitimate according to the rules of eurostat and the commission. </p>
<p>the <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the second question is: <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that today. </p>
<p>the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> that: <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> cutting the link. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know how to <span class='comment'>comment</span> about mr steinbr√ºck 's assessment, other than saying that obviously <span class='subject'>we</span> are always very pleased when people say that the ecb is the only institution that works. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this today, by the way, but the last discussion <span class='subject'>we</span> had a month-and-a-half ago showed that the governing council, its vast majority, wants to keep, to retain the open-endedness feature of the asset purchase programme as it 's been designed in the last monetary policy council. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> a lot about what <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to do next. </p>
<p>so, it was <span class='negation'>not</span> in the introductory statement, as <span class='subject'>we</span> had <span class='comment'>considered</span> that it was better for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you directly, on the occasion of the press conference, what the position of the governing council was. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> know, and <span class='subject'>we</span> have known for a certain period of time, that as far as inflation was concerned <span class='subject'>we</span> had inertia, persistence of inflation around 2%, and that is something that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>explain</span> to ourselves -- <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more -- with the price of oil, some increase in the price of processed and unprocessed food, and indirect taxation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the political developments in portugal, because it would <span class='negation'>not</span> be <span class='subject'>my</span> job to do so. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly would <span class='negation'>not</span> and could <span class='negation'>not</span> recreate that sort of market, because it was <span class='comment'>considered</span> -- some of these imperfections were actually <span class='comment'>considered</span> one of the major roots or the major causes of the financial crisis. </p>
<p>certainly across the atlantic the federal reserve has a very important responsibility, and it is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>my</span> responsibility to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> see how there could be a counterweight to the ecb. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that but it is extremely visible and it is clear that the world is very complex and that you have a combination of forces that are pushing inflation at a global level down and others that are pushing inflation up. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> trust that the question is <span class='negation'>not</span> too much <span class='comment'>addressed</span> to the ecb in your mind. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are in a symmetrical position -- <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>assume</span> that the federal reserve would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> by saying" yes, <span class='subject'>we</span> are under the influence of the ecb, if they do this, <span class='subject'>we</span> would do that ''. </p>
<p>usually, <span class='subject'>i</span> think that a central banker should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on speeches of other central bankers, so <span class='subject'>i</span> will refrain from <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on the speech presented by <span class='subject'>my</span> colleague, greenspan, last week. </p>
<p>they have been successful, <span class='negation'>not</span> only the various monetary policy announcements, but especially so the negative deposit rate, the negative rate on <span class='subject'>our</span> deposit facility was <span class='comment'>considered</span> to be one of the reasons for this success. </p>
<p>well, it did <span class='negation'>n't</span> really come as a surprise because, as <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>told</span> you a moment ago, this data is mostly due to the changes in the price of energy. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> really do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that in the governing council and <span class='subject'>i</span> can only <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> share this view. </p>
<p>the general feeling in europe, taking into account public opinion, is that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to take <span class='subject'>our</span> decision in full independence, meaning that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> do something because <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>told</span> to do something. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>react</span> to other central banks ' communications ; <span class='subject'>we</span> simply <span class='comment'>react</span> to what <span class='subject'>we</span> see as the changes in <span class='subject'>our</span> medium term outlook. </p>
<p>and that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> do something because <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>told</span> to do the contrary. </p>
<p>what <span class='subject'>we</span> have seen in the past few cases of elections outcomes does <span class='negation'>n't</span> suggest that markets <span class='comment'>reacted</span> in a way that would undermine confidence. </p>
<p>on the first and <span class='subject'>we</span> were always -- and it goes back in tradition -- <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> risks about inflation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> inform you about interventions, although <span class='subject'>i</span> could easily <span class='comment'>mention</span> a figure, the figure is zero, but then <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an exchange rate policy, <span class='subject'>we</span> have a policy aimed at achieving price stability and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an explicit exchange rate policy or exchange rate aim vis-√†-vis other major currencies. </p>
<p>if <span class='subject'>i</span> had expectations, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> give you and nor do you <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>me</span> to give you a figure, but it is <span class='subject'>our</span> intention <span class='negation'>not</span> to find ourselves in a position that would constitute a liquidity trap. </p>
<p>as regards the european framework, <span class='subject'>i</span> will only say at this stage that the governing council has <span class='negation'>not</span> taken a definitive position on this and that it is something that it will continue to <span class='comment'>discuss</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>and so the fact that the governing council of the ecb always calls on member states to stick to the revised pact is fully backed <span class='negation'>not</span> only by the legal consideration that the pact is the uniting framework on which the executive branches were unanimous, but also by financial consideration and by economic consideration and, particularly, the ricardian effect that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> on behalf of the governing council in this introductory statement, namely the fact that confidence in the sustainability -- the long-term sustainability -- of the fiscal position is very important for the economy -- for the confidence of economic agents, whether households or corporate. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> a precise figure but <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that whatever will come from the various institutions before the march meeting will confirm what <span class='subject'>we</span> trust, namely that global growth and european growth would be lower than has been previously projected. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> were so focused on <span class='subject'>our</span> decision on monetary policy that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> saying that 2% was <span class='comment'>considered</span> ex-ante by the governing council as a low level which could <span class='negation'>not</span> be displaced. </p>
<p>these are the three main reasons why <span class='subject'>we</span> should observe a level of inflation during the next few months which is above what <span class='subject'>we</span> had projected before, which is what all observers had projected before, because they did <span class='negation'>not</span> take into account the three elements that <span class='subject'>i</span> have just <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>reacting</span> to other central banks ' monetary policy decisions. </p>
<p>well, first of all <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> have expressed ourselves sufficiently clearly in real time <span class='negation'>not</span> to have to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on <span class='subject'>our</span> analysis today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think so and <span class='subject'>we</span> will also <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that in a thorough manner in the context of the forthcoming euro 11 meetings. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on other strategies and tactics, but as far as <span class='subject'>our</span> own strategy and tactics are concerned, <span class='subject'>we</span> are credible and will continue to solidly anchor <span class='subject'>our</span> expectations, which <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> to be <span class='subject'>our</span> major asset. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you anything about the speed, or the scope, with which the snail is creeping or moving. </p>
<p>well, first of all, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> joining investment banks in <span class='comment'>speculating</span> on what either stock prices or interest rates will be doing in the near future. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> today the specifics of the instruments, but rather to determine and assess the stance that <span class='subject'>we</span> may have to take in march. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on the figures because <span class='subject'>we</span> will, as you know, publish them next week in the monthly bulletin. </p>
<p>first of all, because some of this is going to be retained, <span class='negation'>not</span> available for sale, but also for the opposite reason because these markets are bound to <span class='comment'>respond</span> positively in size to <span class='subject'>our</span> actions. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on future rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on this issue. </p>
<p>on your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure that <span class='subject'>we</span> can characterise the situation quite as simply as <span class='subject'>we</span> said, because on the one hand you have the objective figures that you were implicitly <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> -- the eonia, the euribor interest rates and also, as regards the external side of the coin, exchange rates. </p>
<p>on the second question, a review is currently under way so it would <span class='negation'>not</span> be appropriate for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on speculations regarding the outcome. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think that the main message of the party concerned was that insofar as <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> decided on the calibration and on the transition period, <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that there is already a package that has been decided. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> major disasters, but it is quite important that full light be shed and that there is full transparency. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more than that. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> certainly wish that everything goes according to schedule and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> political developments in several euro area countries to delay the developments on the srm. </p>
<p>so the present inflation rates are <span class='negation'>not</span> unexpected, and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>explained</span> the reasons there might be. </p>
<p>second, <span class='subject'>i</span> think that the messages that markets are sending -- and <span class='negation'>not</span> only markets, <span class='subject'>i</span> think all of you would send the same messages -- to the countries that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> are very simple: stability and reforms. </p>
<p>of course, people who live in institutions like ours would like to see everything happening very fast, but often the speed that non-elected institutions have in mind is <span class='negation'>not</span> the same as the actual political speed in different countries, which does <span class='negation'>n't</span> mean that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>n't</span> continue to urge them to <span class='comment'>react</span>. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> already said here that <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the day-to-day and week-to-week evolution of currencies on markets. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> further on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rates, as you know. </p>
<p>and again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you how disappointed <span class='subject'>we</span> were by the attitude of governments in 2004 and 2005 and the extent to which <span class='subject'>we</span> expressed <span class='subject'>our</span> grave concern at the time and the extent to which <span class='subject'>we</span> have been vindicated in <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement at the time by what has happened since then. </p>
<p>and it is for that reason that <span class='subject'>we</span> trust that, when <span class='subject'>we</span> take <span class='subject'>our</span> decisions on the basis of this aim of preserving and reinforcing confidence, <span class='negation'>not</span> only are <span class='subject'>we</span>, of course, doing what <span class='subject'>we</span> are called upon to do, namely maintaining price stability, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are also creating an environment favourable to growth and job creation, as <span class='subject'>i</span> just <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>as to the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> think governments have <span class='comment'>responded</span> and <span class='subject'>i</span> think it is exaggerated also to say that governments can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span>. </p>
<p>so that is just procedure, but in substance <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> gave a plea for a responsible policy of fiscal consolidation and then <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual countries ' announcements. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on an individual wage settlement such as the one you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>that is the other dimension <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talked</span> about. </p>
<p>on your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a specific auction. </p>
<p>but, by and large, <span class='subject'>i</span> would read the recent developments <span class='negation'>not</span> so much as an example of market fragility, but simply as an example that markets are <span class='comment'>expecting</span> reforms. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> when. </p>
<p>as <span class='negation'>not</span> only markets but also survey indicators show, the second consideration is that while the hicp path is what it is, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have just <span class='comment'>discussed</span> with you a moment ago, inflation excluding food and energy drifts slightly higher over the forecast horizon. </p>
<p>on the letter, <span class='subject'>i</span> 'd rather, frankly, <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>these are really issues specific to a certain country and <span class='subject'>i</span> just do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>generally, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on other central banks ' monetary policy actions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific irish economic management. </p>
<p>for the euro area <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> recessionary developments. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> in a position to <span class='comment'>predict</span> precisely when <span class='subject'>we</span> will reach the magic 2%. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>us</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> forget that all the data that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today do <span class='negation'>not</span> take into account the impact of the second lrto. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think it is useful to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about break ups or such things. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on things that have <span class='negation'>not</span> yet been published. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the treaty. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> comply with laws ; <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> laws. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> push ; <span class='subject'>we</span> comply with legislation ; <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> legislation. </p>
<p>third, <span class='subject'>we</span> certainly have to try to help with regard to what <span class='subject'>i</span> would call one of the very important challenges, <span class='negation'>not</span> for the ecb itself, but for europe as a whole, the structural reforms <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> explicitly <span class='comment'>discuss</span> investors ' confidence in the euro, but <span class='subject'>we</span> did, very explicitly, <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the development of the euro, which includes, of course, an assessment of investors ' confidence. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the american monetary or fiscal policy in the context of global growth, and that means <span class='subject'>i</span> also do <span class='negation'>not</span> listen to advice <span class='subject'>i</span> get from the outside on <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy. </p>
<p>when <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>answered</span> anatole kaletsky and said that <span class='subject'>i</span> agreed with him that the growth differential between the two major economic areas in the world was a large part of the explanation for the exchange rate developments, <span class='subject'>i</span> said a large part, i.e. there is more which <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> fully <span class='comment'>explain</span>. </p>
<p>the question was about what you asked, and <span class='subject'>i</span> said," <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really thought or <span class='comment'>talked</span> about it. </p>
<p>if <span class='subject'>i</span> may <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the second question, by saying that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> yet <span class='comment'>examined</span> completely the details of this. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>our</span> position -- which has also been <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the macroprudential forum where <span class='subject'>we</span> have the governing council and the supervisory board at the same time -- <span class='subject'>our</span> position has been that first, there is reason to change the present system of zero risk weights ; second, that the revision should <span class='negation'>not</span> create undue turbulence in markets where sovereign debt is used, like for instance the repo market and in general short-term money markets ; and third, that it should be a change in the international standard, meaning, coming out of the basel committee discussion -- a principle, by the way, that is also <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the five presidents ' report: that annual revision of the sovereign debt risk weight regime should be decided in an international context to ensure a level playing field. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='comment'>expect</span> a continuation of market volatility, certainly until the referendum ; <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about the outcome of the referendum, but probably even after the referendum. </p>
<p>as regards the preparation for this -- <span class='subject'>i</span> would say very impressive -- press conference, to be frank, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that you would be that numerous, <span class='subject'>i</span> did as <span class='subject'>i</span> always do. </p>
<p>for the foreseeable future, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>addressed</span> this question very specifically at <span class='subject'>our</span> meeting today. </p>
<p>that is for the council of ministers and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the decisions made by other central banks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span>, however, going to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about what would happen should this situation develop further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rate developments. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on a more rapid development of whichever exchange rate, as you can understand. </p>
<p>as to your second question, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it at all today. </p>
<p>now, on the room for manoeuvre <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> is, well, in the first place when something is before the courts you do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> and particularly <span class='negation'>not</span> when it concerns such an esteemed colleague of mine. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have a target, as you know and -- as mr. issing will <span class='comment'>explain</span> later -- <span class='subject'>we</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> have a target. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>we</span> said very carefully that <span class='subject'>we</span> urge all of them to live up to their responsibilities and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> further on that. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on what <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the real interest rates, which have to be analysed at a global level and <span class='negation'>not</span> only at the level of europe or the us. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> also insist -- although it was <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the question -- on the fact that the monetary analysis calls for vigilance, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, because <span class='subject'>we</span> see dynamism of m3 and dynamism, by definition, of the counterparts of m3 which means that <span class='subject'>we</span> -- from that standpoint -- can see that <span class='subject'>we</span> could have an overhang of liquidity. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> could see that the explanation <span class='subject'>we</span> had on the portfolio shifts and then the unwinding of portfolio shifts, which was a convincing element in understanding what was happening, does <span class='negation'>not</span> seem now in <span class='subject'>our</span> own analysis to be convincing in <span class='comment'>explaining</span> the present dynamism of m3. </p>
<p>that is <span class='negation'>not</span> something that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>discussed</span> recently. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> anything in advance of <span class='subject'>our</span> meeting other than say what <span class='subject'>we</span> have already conveyed to the chinese and they know exactly <span class='subject'>our</span> sentiment on a possible better functioning of the global economy, if some moves were to be made. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> call upon all countries, <span class='negation'>not</span> only the countries that you have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>, to be ahead of the curve in terms of their public finances, in terms of maintaining their costs at a competitive level ; and last but <span class='negation'>not</span> least in terms of embarking on the appropriate structural reforms. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> term runs for another three years and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> another evaluation within that period. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it in substance. </p>
<p>and if you want details on the deliberations of the governing council, <span class='subject'>i</span> would sum it up in the following fashion: <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> at all the option of decreasing rates ; <span class='subject'>we</span> assessed the situation ; and <span class='subject'>we</span> concluded that maintaining the present rates was the correct decision, taking everything into account, and that continued vigilance was of the essence. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>examine</span> cutting interest rates. </p>
<p>and as such, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> believe - although <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on forecasts which still have to be released - <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> believe that they are already now too optimistic. </p>
<p>well, since <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the second question either. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> inclined to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on the impact. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> and do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> that the conversion itself will have a significant impact on inflation. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> in the habit of <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on measures taken in individual countries of the euro area. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> that question, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> believe in" complots ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have to say, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> actually <span class='comment'>considered</span> this as an explicit policy issue so far. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> quoted, in <span class='subject'>my</span> introductory statement, a range of forecasts - effectively - and <span class='negation'>not</span> the german ones in particular, which, if <span class='subject'>i</span> look at the forecasts as <span class='subject'>we</span> know them - they have <span class='negation'>not</span> all been published yet - of the imf, of the oecd and of other international organisations, they all revise the <span class='comment'>expected</span> growth in the euro area and will, and they will also revise the euro area downwards. </p>
<p>you specifically - <span class='subject'>i</span> noted - did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> the difference in interest rate levels. </p>
<p>and as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, the exchange rate itself is <span class='negation'>not</span> a target for <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy so if you want to know what the difference is, <span class='subject'>i</span> believe <span class='subject'>i</span> have very quickly <span class='comment'>explained</span> that. </p>
<p>that is, first of all the public statement <span class='subject'>i</span> made vis-√†-vis the european council, that <span class='subject'>i</span> was appointed for eight years and that <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> or regard it as likely that <span class='subject'>i</span> would serve the full term. </p>
<p>as regards slovakia, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have a position of the governing council on slovakia and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on question marks that one might have, which are fully legitimate. </p>
<p>and the following statement <span class='subject'>i</span> made - and that was the last <span class='subject'>i</span> made and will be the last that <span class='subject'>i</span> make - was that <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this issue again. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will only confirm what <span class='subject'>i</span> have said, namely that 2% is <span class='negation'>not</span> the lowest level that <span class='subject'>we</span> would have decided ex ante, second, that zero interest rates at the present time is <span class='negation'>not</span> something that <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='comment'>consider</span> appropriate. </p>
<p>on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> have said already that 2% was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> by the governing council to be a lower limit and that <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='comment'>examine</span> the situation at <span class='subject'>our</span> next meeting on the basis of <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy strategy and the information <span class='subject'>we</span> will have. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> say that <span class='subject'>we</span> have constraints that <span class='comment'>explain</span> why <span class='subject'>we</span> could <span class='negation'>not</span> introduce other non-standard measures. </p>
<p>but at this stage <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to repeat too lengthily what <span class='subject'>i</span> have said, but <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that, regarding risks to price stability over the medium term, unexpected further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than <span class='comment'>expected</span> slowdown in the economy could put downward pressure on inflation, whilst upside risks to price stability could materialise if the falling commodity prices were to reverse and if domestic pressures turn out to be stronger. </p>
<p>well, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have said, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> usually <span class='comment'>comment</span> on single countries -- and this holds for spain as it held before for italy, ireland and so on. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> remember having seen the imf 's managing director <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think one should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to such questions in general, because there are very important differences among market-places and among economies. </p>
<p>at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on or qualify what <span class='subject'>we</span> could do or <span class='negation'>not</span> do. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you in substance. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about a monetary base which is rapidly disappearing or shrinking to an extremely low value. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> the conclusion which will be drawn following the proposal of the commission by jean-claude juncker as chairman of the eurogroup. </p>
<p>as regards your third question on structural reforms, again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> the next meeting and meetings of the eurogroup. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> that at all. </p>
<p>on the abs, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the scope of the abs, other than again reaffirming that it should be real economy-oriented, oriented towards non-financial companies of the private sector. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see households postponing their spending plans and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see the various features of this phenomenon that <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> on other occasions. </p>
<p>in a sense what <span class='subject'>i</span> said before could be used in several ways: <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on politicians ' statements. </p>
<p>now here <span class='subject'>we</span> are facing a completely different set-up where <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about individual banks, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about countries ; banking systems. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> what are the conditions whereby countries would <span class='negation'>not</span> receive the assistance of the ecb. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> give you at this stage a position of the governing council as regards the degree to which <span class='subject'>we</span> would <span class='comment'>consider</span> that - at the moment at which <span class='subject'>we</span> are speaking - growth potential has diminished. </p>
<p>so both five-years and ten-years were decreasing, but the five-year forward break-even itself was quite steady at a level which <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> satisfactory. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> have to say that -- and this is the reason why <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> changing the structure of <span class='subject'>our</span> framework -- <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that it has served <span class='subject'>us</span> very well, particularly since the beginning of the financial turbulence. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> exclude of course the by-product that <span class='subject'>i</span> just <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>as regards what will be said at the next meeting of the eurogroup, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> ; it is a meeting of the eurogroup and it will depend very much on what will be said by the various delegations -- <span class='negation'>not</span> by only one, but by the various delegations that will present their own situations and intentions. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>we</span> were <span class='negation'>not</span> an institution that <span class='comment'>considered</span> that what <span class='subject'>we</span> had been observing since 9 august 2007 was a very temporary short-term episode. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> banks what is to be done, what is to be increased or what lending figures they should have. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on stock exchanges. </p>
<p>as regards the letter, it was a personal, individual letter, which jean-claude juncker did <span class='negation'>not</span>, to <span class='subject'>my</span> knowledge, <span class='comment'>discuss</span> with the members of the eurogroup. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that with the governing council. </p>
<p>now, as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> in the interim publish the results of these projections, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can confirm that the <span class='comment'>expected</span> inflation, both for the rest of this year, as well as in 2004 and 2005, is <span class='negation'>not</span> fundamentally, is <span class='negation'>not</span> essentially, affected by changes that have taken place in the exchange rate or in oil prices. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure that <span class='subject'>i</span> understand exactly what kind of discord you are referring to between the ecb and the markets, but if you want to <span class='comment'>clarify</span> this further, <span class='subject'>i</span> can be more precise in answering. </p>
<p>and the differences between earlier and recent projections -- <span class='subject'>we</span> take into account <span class='negation'>not</span> only the change in oil prices you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> but also other relevant factors that influence the future evolution of prices -- are only slight. </p>
<p>well, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> in the habit of <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on developments either in the tax field or in other fields of economic policy in individual countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have been invited by jean-claude juncker to participate in the eurogroup meeting and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>predict</span> what will be said there. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>our</span> message applies to absolutely all countries, but in particular to those countries where <span class='subject'>we</span> think that there might be a risk of the commitments undertaken <span class='negation'>not</span> being respected ; in particular the berlin commitment, which <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>, and the full implementation of the stability and growth pact with a number of provisions that <span class='subject'>we</span> will certainly insist on. </p>
<p>that being said, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> the meeting which will take place next monday at the level of the eurogroup. </p>
<p>and if <span class='subject'>we</span> had reached that stage <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure whether <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to go back to the figures <span class='subject'>i</span> gave you, but those who say that the euro is working against job creation are <span class='negation'>not</span> justified, when you look at the figures <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that they would <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what <span class='subject'>we</span> do ourselves </p>
<p>that means that the extraordinary growth rates which <span class='subject'>we</span> have seen in the united states for a prolonged period of time and which <span class='subject'>we</span> and other authorities did <span class='negation'>not</span> regard as being sustainable in the very long term are coming down from annualised rates of 5¬†1/2% or even close to 6% per quarter in the direction of lower rates for what seems - to <span class='subject'>me</span> - to be a normal and to be <span class='comment'>expected</span> - may <span class='subject'>i</span> call it - soft landing in the united states, which is in the interest of the entire world. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the spread, the indexed rates or the absence of them that <span class='subject'>we</span> may decide. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> what <span class='subject'>our</span> next staff projections are likely to be: <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>comment</span> on them to you in a month 's time. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> had chance to <span class='comment'>talk</span> to the president of the eurogroup, but <span class='subject'>i</span> am absolutely sure that he has been misunderstood. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>responded</span> to that question on one particular country but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to embark now on a series of questions and <span class='comment'>answers</span> about individual countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to do next year in terms of monetary policy. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> matters related to your second question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> emergency liquidity assistance to be monetary financing ; it is one of <span class='subject'>our</span> instruments. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am very sorry but <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> in a position to <span class='comment'>answer</span> this question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an <span class='comment'>answer</span> now. </p>
<p>`` social partners '' means that one has to take into consideration everything that <span class='subject'>i</span> have said on competitiveness, on the level of unemployment and on the need to maintain price stability, so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> further. </p>
<p>well, on the second question, as you know, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>the reason for this is <span class='negation'>not</span> only that they had decided earlier that <span class='subject'>we</span> should deliver price stability -- let 's <span class='negation'>not</span> forget, <span class='subject'>we</span> have a mandate given by the exemplary democracies of the eu 27 -- but also because the period is such that they are calling even more insistently on <span class='subject'>us</span>, and <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='comment'>respond</span> to this frank request of <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the ill feelings, but certainly, what <span class='subject'>i</span> would suggest is you go back to the last 15-plus years and look at which countries have been in the excessive deficit procedure most often, over the last, say, 15, 16, 17 years, and then draw a conclusion from there. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this evolution. </p>
<p>they are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>telling</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> be vigilant on inflation. </p>
<p>so that is the great challenge of <span class='subject'>our</span> time, and <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> exclude ourselves from that challenge, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> have a role to play. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>telling</span> you anything that would be interpreted as suggesting <span class='subject'>we</span> are preparing a rate cut. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> see this poll and <span class='subject'>i</span> am a little bit surprised by the figures you are <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> but <span class='subject'>i</span> accept it fully. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you anything other than the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> are pragmatic and <span class='subject'>we</span> will look at facts and figures. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would certainly hope so, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> own projections, so <span class='subject'>we</span> will see what <span class='subject'>our</span> own projections are. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on that, because there are still investigations under way and <span class='subject'>we</span> will see exactly what it is all about. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> say that it 's easy to <span class='comment'>answer</span>, but it has to be <span class='comment'>addressed</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will only say that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on absurd questions. </p>
<p>the japanese have <span class='negation'>not</span> yet been in <span class='comment'>touch</span> with <span class='subject'>me</span>, nor with others, about what they want to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> in tokyo on exchange rates. </p>
<p>first to your second question, the message <span class='subject'>i</span> gave is clear and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> again on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the profile of <span class='comment'>expected</span> market interest rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on portugal. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to ask mr. noyer to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> about the" when '', precisely if <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>assume</span> he knows as much as <span class='subject'>i</span> do. </p>
<p>what <span class='subject'>i</span> can say, and <span class='negation'>not</span> regarding the united states in particular, but with regard to the global economy as a whole, and <span class='subject'>us</span>, practically all the hard data and facts and figures that <span class='subject'>we</span> have observed since the start of the recovery -lrb- for <span class='subject'>us</span> this was in the third quarter of 2009 and in sync with the global recovery -rrb- have been better than <span class='comment'>expected</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> further. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what <span class='subject'>we</span> buy or on what <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> buy. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> at all. </p>
<p>taking your questions in reverse order, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> stopping the minimum bid rate. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> turkey. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> promise today that <span class='subject'>i</span> will stick to <span class='subject'>my</span> promise <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that issue again. </p>
<p>you are asking questions that are so hypothetical that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an <span class='comment'>answer</span> to them. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on that as it seems to <span class='subject'>me</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> are clear enough. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> underestimate that when <span class='subject'>i</span> said clearly on behalf of the governing council that it was possible to increase rates today, it was <span class='comment'>considered</span> an important message. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on exchange rates, <span class='subject'>i</span> would only say that each central bank in the world -- whether it is in japan, in the united states, in sweden or in the united kingdom and of course here -- decides on the basis of its own responsibilities. </p>
<p>on long-term interest rates, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to pronounce myself on the united states, and the person best qualified to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to your question as regards the other side of the atlantic is ben bernanke. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure that it is exactly appropriate in the present period: first of all <span class='subject'>we</span> have a number of other indicators that are also supposed to <span class='comment'>predict</span> future episodes in the cycle and they are <span class='negation'>not</span> at all giving the same indications. </p>
<p>and as regards central banks, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what the other central banks are doing. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> intention to change <span class='subject'>our</span> deposit rate and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that what has been done elsewhere is within a context which is very different from ours with regard to the handling of the money market. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that this is something <span class='subject'>we</span> should look at now. </p>
<p>in <span class='subject'>our</span> deliberations <span class='subject'>we</span> always, as you know, <span class='comment'>consider</span> all arguments, and the assets and liabilities associated with all decisions -- and, just as <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> moving to be an inappropriate decision, <span class='subject'>we</span> also <span class='comment'>considered</span> moving by fifty basis points to be an inappropriate decision. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>when <span class='subject'>we</span> will judge that monetary policy is <span class='negation'>not</span> accommodative, <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on italy ; <span class='subject'>i</span> got a call and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>responded</span>. </p>
<p>as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that this was <span class='negation'>not</span> in line with the rules in the european union, and <span class='subject'>i</span> must confess that <span class='subject'>i</span> was myself very heartened to see that the feeling that something abnormal had been done was shared by a major institution: the constitutional court in poland ; so <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>mention</span> that as something that <span class='subject'>we</span> have noted. </p>
<p>so be aware that short-term evolutions should <span class='negation'>not</span> be <span class='comment'>considered</span> important in the conduct of <span class='subject'>our</span> policy when <span class='subject'>we</span> have to cope with shocks because what counts is that <span class='subject'>our</span> policy is driven in an eighteen-months ' to two-years ' perspective to deliver price stability in line with <span class='subject'>our</span> definition. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> say that <span class='subject'>we</span> are satisfied by all the decisions that have been taken, either by price-setters in europe or by social partners, but <span class='subject'>we</span> are solemnly <span class='comment'>telling</span> them that they can count on <span class='subject'>us</span> to guarantee price stability in the medium term, to deliver price stability in the medium term and to solidly anchor inflation expectations. </p>
<p>the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>" heightened alertness '' or" strong vigilance '' does <span class='negation'>n't</span> mean anything. </p>
<p>... but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have an <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> your question. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are all reflecting, <span class='negation'>not</span> only in europe but also at the global level, on the different behaviours that <span class='subject'>we</span> have observed from the employment angle in various countries, to understand better what dynamics are at stake and what might <span class='comment'>explain</span> those differences. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to the question because you asked a very specific question, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> embark on <span class='comment'>responding</span> to questions on particular countries. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> customary for <span class='subject'>me</span> to say in advance what <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='comment'>discuss</span> in the g7 meetings. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> a secret: <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>tell</span> you that the next survey of professional forecasters will give <span class='subject'>us</span>, for five years, 1.9%, which is a confirmation of the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the introductory statement. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on your own hypothesis. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the decision of the bank of england, which happened to be on exactly the same day. </p>
<p>as regards the position of central banks in general, as far as you refer <span class='negation'>not</span> only to <span class='subject'>us</span>, but to the community of central banks, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that <span class='subject'>we</span> all <span class='comment'>consider</span> that being credible in <span class='subject'>our</span> mandate to deliver price stability <span class='negation'>not</span> only on a short-term basis, but on the medium and long-term basis, and therefore, solidly anchoring inflationary expectations, is of the essence. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on financial stability. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> only the mandate given to <span class='subject'>us</span> by the treaty but also <span class='subject'>our</span> responsibility vis-√†-vis the households of europe and the fellow citizens of europe, who <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> to deliver price stability. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> additional increases in prices -- <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioning</span> past increases that have already been decided and fully incorporated in <span class='subject'>our</span> own projections, but rather the possible future increases in administrative prices and indirect taxes -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> the traditional -- in this press conference -- second-round effects, in particular wages and salaries increases. </p>
<p>at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am very grateful that you do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>me</span> to reply in french, because <span class='subject'>my</span> french is getting a bit rusty. </p>
<p>as regards your first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> limits. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> were <span class='negation'>n't</span> happy when <span class='subject'>we</span> were <span class='comment'>talking</span> about an increase of 15% and, as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>we</span> knew that could <span class='negation'>not</span> be sustained. </p>
<p>the" why '' <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>answered</span>, the" when '' <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> am sorry for <span class='negation'>not</span> being able to <span class='comment'>answer</span>, but what is important is that it is <span class='negation'>not</span> as simple as it may look. </p>
<p>and let <span class='subject'>me</span> just say -- and this is <span class='negation'>not</span> a <span class='comment'>comment</span> on those particular future decisions ; it 's also a general <span class='comment'>comment</span> -- that <span class='subject'>we</span> are extremely keen on preserving what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> essential in the present circumstances, namely the fact that this institution, the ecb, is an anchor of stability and confidence, and that all that <span class='subject'>we</span> do must be understood and perceived as such by <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> forget this question, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>answer</span> that question. </p>
<p>as to the moves mr. tietmeyer may or will make, passively or actively, <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on whether it would be over and above 2%, or below 2%, but it will be higher at the end of the year. </p>
<p>it was a phone call, and <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p>of course, what <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>talking</span> about is quite recent, so <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> to see immediate or significant changes in <span class='subject'>our</span> own figures. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> passively <span class='comment'>expecting</span> future economic developments. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will just try to <span class='comment'>answer</span> in very abstract terms, because this is <span class='negation'>not</span> an issue that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today, and <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>we</span> should focus on the decisions that were <span class='comment'>discussed</span> by the governing council today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>responding</span> on greece, as your question was <span class='negation'>not</span> on greece but on all countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> a high exchange rate, but - for the rest - <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> it to happen. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> sudden and quick results, but it is pretty certain that the results will come. </p>
<p>as regards your second question <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on that because it would take a long time, but <span class='subject'>we</span> believe that <span class='subject'>our</span> own monetary policy concept, which is based on two pillars -lrb- i.e. economic analysis and monetary analysis -rrb-, allows <span class='subject'>us</span> -- thanks to the monetary analysis and the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> have a medium-term definition of price stability -- to incorporate elements that are associated with rapid increases in outstanding credit, including the impact on asset inflation, which could itself create inflation through the wealth channel and, if boom is followed by bust, destabilise prices through the deflationary risks that could materialise. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think <span class='subject'>we</span> should over-assess the gravity of what is happening in dubai, but at the same time <span class='subject'>we</span> have to <span class='comment'>consider</span> the impact that a relatively modest event had on the market. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> base-line scenario in the introductory statement, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will only say that <span class='subject'>we</span> will, of course, have the staff projections next month. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>we</span> were unanimous, but that does <span class='negation'>not</span> mean that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> very thoroughly all the elements that are making up the situation <span class='subject'>we</span> are facing at the global level and at the european level. </p>
<p>you know that <span class='subject'>our</span> main message is that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want second-round effects, and when <span class='subject'>we</span> say second-round effects, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>addressing</span> two major possible destabilisations. </p>
<p>as regards your third question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on vigilance in the other direction. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the exchange rate here, as you know. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> are in real time, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will wait until the communiqu√© is published and will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> at this stage. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to launch into the discussions that take place in the basel committee chaired by nout wellink, the governor of the central bank of the netherlands, and the work of the financial stability forum, which is also <span class='comment'>examining</span> the report of the basel committee. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the question about quantifying the strength of the political factors in play. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> stick to rules like the" taylor rule '', so <span class='subject'>i</span> prefer <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> seen that letter, so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on what <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>answer</span> had <span class='subject'>i</span> seen it. </p>
<p>the unemployment criterion is <span class='negation'>not</span> on the list of criteria that <span class='subject'>we</span> will have to <span class='comment'>examine</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> participate in the game of <span class='comment'>commenting</span> on the <span class='comment'>comments</span> of others. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> that en passant to say very clearly that it is <span class='negation'>not</span> because, according to the imf, <span class='subject'>we</span> have at a consolidated level only 6% in the present circumstances that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that it is acceptable. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have already <span class='comment'>responded</span> to the third question so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are certainly living in a universe where the weakness of some currencies can be associated with the weakness of domestic features, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on particular currencies. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> recently had <span class='comment'>talks</span> with both the outgoing governor and the incoming governor of the bank of england and the subject was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> believe the markets did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> to wait. </p>
<p>the last question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>, as you know. </p>
<p>at the global level, it is <span class='negation'>not</span> particularly the sentiment of the governing council of the ecb, it is perhaps rather the sentiment at the level of the g10 and of the global economy meeting that <span class='subject'>we</span> regularly have in basel - which <span class='subject'>i</span> have the privilege of chairing - that progressively the very powerful dampening that you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> on global inflation stemming from globalisation itself, and the increase of the share in the global economy coming from very low unit labour cost economy, that this is perhaps gradually diminishing. </p>
<p>all what <span class='subject'>i</span> can say at the moment <span class='subject'>i</span> am speaking - again <span class='subject'>i</span> remain very cautious - by making the synthesis of all the information <span class='subject'>we</span> have been receiving -- information on growth, information on oil price increases, information on exchange rates, all kinds of information -- is that it broadly confirms <span class='subject'>our</span> baseline scenario, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> confirm anything that would suggest that <span class='subject'>our</span> growth projection would be different from the present baseline scenario to the extent that you <span class='comment'>addressed</span> explicitly the question of growth. </p>
<p>exchange rate questions are <span class='negation'>not</span> part of what <span class='subject'>we</span> are presently <span class='comment'>discussing</span>. </p>
<p>on your first point <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> studied the accord that you <span class='comment'>mention</span>. </p>
<p>and then <span class='subject'>i</span> -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> should say <span class='subject'>we</span> -- can <span class='negation'>not</span> and did <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on how the events will evolve once a war breaks out. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> particularly on one economy, because it seems to <span class='subject'>me</span> that what <span class='subject'>we</span> are observing in terms of surveys, as well as in terms of soft data and hard data, is by and large in line in the various national economies that make up the euro area. </p>
<p>on your first question, it is <span class='negation'>not</span> for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> in real time on what the market does or does <span class='negation'>not</span> think. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> thought, taking into account the trend of the baseline scenario and taking into account the risks to price stability, according to <span class='subject'>our</span> analysis of their presence and their dynamics, that it was the right decision <span class='negation'>not</span> to move this time whilst, at the same time, clearly, <span class='subject'>we</span> have increased vigilance and <span class='subject'>i</span> also <span class='comment'>commented</span> on what is presently <span class='comment'>expected</span> by markets. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that question. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> like to <span class='comment'>answer</span> speculative or hypothetical questions. </p>
<p>it is <span class='negation'>not</span> that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> wish to <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> give an <span class='comment'>answer</span> to the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>along different lines, which <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on too much: more structural analysis, more understanding of what is necessary in the period of fat cats and affluent episodes in the economic cycle. </p>
<p>first of all, arcelor and mittal steel are <span class='negation'>not</span> in the services sector, if <span class='subject'>i</span> may say so <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that at all. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> those reasons and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> again on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>on the latter, highly political question, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> that. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>explained</span> why, despite the fact that there is very abundant liquidity, it does <span class='negation'>not</span> drive <span class='subject'>us</span> to <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to change the balance of risks to price stability. </p>
<p>in <span class='subject'>our</span> understanding of the overall assessment of the functioning of markets at the level of the euro area as a whole and taking into account the fact that the market has <span class='negation'>not</span> been functioning correctly until now at least, <span class='subject'>we</span> still <span class='comment'>consider</span> it necessary to have this non-standard way. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that, for instance, the profile of growth next year has changed. </p>
<p>on the first <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>if <span class='subject'>we</span> were, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p>then <span class='subject'>i</span> have to say that it is <span class='negation'>not</span> the final decision, as <span class='subject'>we</span> have said very clearly today that <span class='subject'>we</span> will incorporate all <span class='comment'>remarks</span> which are made before <span class='subject'>we</span> take <span class='subject'>our</span> decision to launch, which will be taken at the beginning of next year. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am reporting here on the outcome of the governing council 's considerations so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that either. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> ask you to remind <span class='subject'>me</span> of the interest rates before the euro in the country that you have been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>, and what the interest rate would be in that country if there was <span class='negation'>not</span> an institution here -- namely the ecb - which is credible in the eyes of europe and the rest of the world. </p>
<p>on the downside risks -- and there <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> on the external, but on the domestic, side of the coin -- <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that since q2 and q3 of last year <span class='subject'>we</span> have observed something materialising which had been <span class='comment'>expected</span> for quite a period of time, namely the pick-up in investment. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the european commission 's statements but <span class='subject'>i</span> think what is meant by that statement is that ireland has achieved remarkable, very significant and substantial progress on the front of fiscal consolidation, but also on the front of bank restructuring. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that at all today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that the possibility is <span class='negation'>not</span> excluded that, after having carefully <span class='comment'>examined</span> the situation, <span class='subject'>we</span> could decide to move <span class='subject'>our</span> rates by a small amount in <span class='subject'>our</span> next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, taking into account the situation. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> now. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> it specifically, but, in assessing all the indicators <span class='subject'>we</span> had, <span class='subject'>we</span> paid due attention to the fact that in various regions of euro area there seems to be an acceleration in wage demands which, by itself, is adding to <span class='subject'>our</span> conviction that it is about time to raise interest rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>elaborated</span> on the economic analysis and on the monetary analysis a moment ago, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to repeat what <span class='subject'>i</span> already said -- that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that the monetary analysis gives <span class='subject'>us</span> very pertinent information. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would also stress the fact that <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>addressing</span> only wage-price spiralling. </p>
<p>on the independence of central banks: of course, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on <span class='subject'>our</span> own institution. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in <span class='subject'>our</span> discussion on that particular point. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> also said that <span class='subject'>we</span> had increased vigilance and, as you noted, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> only said that <span class='subject'>our</span> vigilance had increased, but <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> it three times. </p>
<p>the second revision will follow, but <span class='subject'>we</span> need some more months to work on it ; <span class='subject'>we</span> will publish it as soon as <span class='subject'>we</span> have it, but <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> it to show the same dynamics, although it will go in the same direction. </p>
<p>so the very last question <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have to <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> be very consistent in <span class='subject'>my</span> stance if <span class='subject'>i</span> were to <span class='comment'>answer</span> your question when <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> the first question which was put to <span class='subject'>me</span>. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am afraid <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the evaluation of the strategy, which is under way at the moment. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know when that will happen, and the" when '' is very determinant for the kind of scenario you are <span class='comment'>discussing</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on what will happen after the war, if and when the war is over. </p>
<p>as far as <span class='subject'>my</span> succession is concerned, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> take questions on that subject, with the exception of one <span class='comment'>answer</span> that <span class='subject'>i</span> can give: in the letter <span class='subject'>i</span> wrote to president aznar in february of last year, when he was president of the european union, <span class='subject'>i</span> literally wrote" dear mr. president, <span class='subject'>i</span> herewith ask you to permit <span class='subject'>me</span> to resign on 9 july 2003, or so much later as is in the interest of a smooth transition of the presidency. '' </p>
<p>from that you can infer that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> changed <span class='subject'>our</span> baseline scenario and that <span class='subject'>our</span> forecasts are still the same as they were when <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>talked</span> to each other one month ago. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have taken note of the forecasts that are being prepared by the staff of the eurosystem, i.e. the ncbs and the ecb, and those forecasts will be made public in <span class='subject'>our</span> forthcoming monthly bulletin -- <span class='subject'>i</span> believe, on 14 december -- so that <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> now on precisely what the forecast would entail for next year. </p>
<p>with regard to the first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> the euro area -- either in aggregate or even individual countries -- to exceed the 3% deficit limit. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the conclusions that another major central bank reached in quite a different situation. </p>
<p>on the budget, there are 12 budgets that <span class='subject'>we</span> have to judge, so <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> give a general <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> at all on what decision the executive board will take when the time comes. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you anything about the conversations <span class='subject'>i</span> had with <span class='subject'>my</span> us colleagues when <span class='subject'>i</span> met them last weekend in basel. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on decisions that have to be taken by colleagues in full liberty and full independence, because that is the nature of the contract. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> pre-committed and <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> strong vigilance. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> always said that <span class='subject'>we</span> were <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expecting</span> growth to be particularly buoyant and that <span class='subject'>we</span> were looking at growth as being uneven. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> say that, because what <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>expecting</span> is a normal behaviour of the market. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> depart from that <span class='comment'>remark</span>. </p>
<p>that is a concept that <span class='subject'>we</span> have been applying since the very beginning and, again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the policies that are pursued by other central banks. </p>
<p>second, the smp: do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> <span class='subject'>me</span> to say anything more than what <span class='subject'>i</span> have said before. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> seen the letter so <span class='subject'>i</span> can only <span class='comment'>comment</span> once <span class='subject'>i</span> have seen it. </p>
<p>of course, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> normally <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific levels or movements. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> are inclined to think that it will <span class='negation'>not</span> be as low as the 1.3% <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> earlier. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have to say that when you look at the figures extracted from the various bond markets -- it 's <span class='negation'>not</span> literature that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='comment'>discussing</span> its fact, figures, numbers, arithmetic -- when <span class='subject'>we</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> would moderately increase <span class='subject'>our</span> rates, <span class='subject'>we</span> gained in terms of credibility. </p>
<p>second, as regards the banking conference in frankfurt which took place approximately a fortnight ago, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> stand up, <span class='subject'>i</span> was there at the banking conference, <span class='subject'>i</span> had been invited, <span class='subject'>i</span> was on the spot, and the chairman of the panel, mr walter, asked <span class='subject'>me</span>" could you <span class='comment'>tell</span> <span class='subject'>us</span>, sir, what <span class='subject'>we</span> need to know and to understand on interest rates and the monetary policy of the ecb ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that a change in the monetary policy stance is going to have a significant effect on economic activity in the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>react</span> on a day-to-day basis, and <span class='subject'>we</span> have exactly the same posture of vigilance that <span class='subject'>we</span> had before. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on that again, because <span class='subject'>we</span> still have the same position and because <span class='subject'>i</span> have reiterated on behalf of the governing council that very same position, namely that <span class='subject'>we</span> are on board for improvement and implementation as regards, in particular, the preventive arm of the pact, depending, of course, on careful examination of the very precise orientations that would be retained by the council of ministers of finance, which is the responsible body. </p>
<p>`` in line '' meaning below or close to 2%, and <span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>clarify</span> more than that. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> further on the stability and growth pact ; <span class='subject'>i</span> have said very clearly what <span class='subject'>our</span> current attitude is. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on the economic reasoning behind this, namely that if you have less debt then you are at an advantage because you have less service of the debt and more room for manoeuvre than other countries ; and why encourage a country to go on piling up debt until it reaches 60% when that particular country could be much better off with less debt? </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on other measures. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> can just confirm that this move that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> is <span class='negation'>not</span> an objective per se, but that what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> to happen will probably take place in all fields. </p>
<p>as regards your first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> ireland in the introductory statement. </p>
<p>as regards your second question on the monetary policy stance, you know that it is <span class='negation'>not</span> customary at all for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what the market might or might <span class='negation'>not</span> think. </p>
<p>as you know, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such statements. </p>
<p>in response to the rest of your question, it is good to be cautious and prudent regarding sensitive matters and <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> in particular on ireland. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on declarations by heads of states and governments, in particular the president of the united states, only to echo him when he says that a strong dollar is in the interest of the united states. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span>, of course, in the medium and long run that, if <span class='subject'>we</span> continue to be steady on structural reforms, <span class='subject'>we</span> will observe -- progressively -- something of that sort, but so far, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> it to be documented or substantiated and that <span class='subject'>we</span> could retain it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on either that interview or the interventions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> would at this stage <span class='negation'>not</span> suggest that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> growth potential for the euro area to have changed significantly upwards. </p>
<p>the impact of the recent further surge in energy prices leads <span class='subject'>us</span> to the conclusion that, if they were <span class='negation'>not</span> to come down quickly, the period during which the actual inflation rates would be over the 2% limit, below which <span class='subject'>we</span> want them to remain, will be somewhat longer than <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>anticipated</span> earlier. </p>
<p>of course, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> either on the level that there is or that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the latter question. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> also say that at this stage -- at this very moment, speaking on behalf of the governing council -- <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> have either sufficient or sufficiently convincing elements to change <span class='subject'>our</span> previous assessment of growth potential, which is based largely but <span class='negation'>not</span> exclusively on productivity considerations. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you about everything mr. fabius said. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this question at all and the governing council has full confidence in nout wellink. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on that. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> alan to still be a member of the fed. </p>
<p>as regards the second question, the ecb is <span class='negation'>not</span> even <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the stability and growth pact, but <span class='subject'>we</span> do play a role, <span class='subject'>i</span> admit, and <span class='subject'>i</span> take great comfort in that at the summit in seville the heads of state or government solemnly declared that they would adhere to the goals set. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> so pleased that the acceleration of output, which <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expected</span>, is taking so long to take hold. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on future developments which <span class='subject'>i</span> hope will <span class='negation'>not</span> take place. </p>
<p>all that being said, it is work in progress and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on this work in progress right now. </p>
<p>by implication, that means that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> fear that the performance of the specific countries you <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> would have a negative contagious effect. </p>
<p>if <span class='subject'>we</span> had, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you, like one of the out-countries has done. </p>
<p>and, for that, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> received a specific invitation and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> to receive one. </p>
<p>on interventions: whatever <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the governing council that did <span class='negation'>not</span> lead to certain decisions, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on interventions. </p>
<p>now, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> quite sure in the italian case, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on that specific country, on the extent to which the disappointing growth performance so far is due to cyclical or to structural factors. </p>
<p>there are, of course, other factors which <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span>, i.e. the war in kosovo, which certainly also has a somewhat different impact on the euro than on the us dollar. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the discussions that took place. </p>
<p>these are procedures that are ongoing and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on them. </p>
<p>on the money gap, <span class='subject'>i</span> prefer <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the performance of individual countries. </p>
<p>well, let <span class='subject'>me</span> say what <span class='subject'>i</span> say ever more often: as a central banker, the one thing <span class='subject'>i</span> have learnt is <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on anything, but rather to fight speculation wherever <span class='subject'>i</span> can. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> yet see signs of a slowing down, although <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> it over time - but the lags are long, as you know - to do so as a result of <span class='subject'>our</span> increase in interest rates last month. </p>
<p>as to whenever and wherever and how <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to use it, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>that is one thing that is meant, and it is <span class='negation'>not</span> simply keynesian-type taxation measures that <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='comment'>talking</span> about. </p>
<p>the last question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> at that stage yet, as <span class='subject'>i</span> just <span class='comment'>explained</span>. </p>
<p>to say at what time is too hard ; <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think it would be right for <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what another country 's government or national central bank is doing, or is about to do. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> dwell on domestic economic policy and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>again, the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> use the additional credit claims as a further way to provide collateral means that <span class='subject'>we</span> have now <span class='comment'>addressed</span> the funding issues -- <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>address</span> the shortage of capital and <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>address</span> the risk aversion that has indeed reached high levels. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said <span class='subject'>i</span> am sorry if <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> know the exact time, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>tell</span> you it will be around the second half of this year. </p>
<p>however, if these policies produce consequences for the exchange rates that do <span class='negation'>not</span> reflect the g20 consensus, <span class='subject'>we</span> will have to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on particular elements or early stages of the discussions being held, which are fairly intensive and, <span class='subject'>i</span> am inclined to say, fruitful. </p>
<p>just one more thing <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> expectation of course in 2020, <span class='subject'>our</span> inflation rate will converge to <span class='subject'>our</span> objective, but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it today. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> look <span class='negation'>not</span> only at that, but at all other information, in particular the information that you have been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>. </p>
<p>they are in line with what <span class='subject'>we</span> had already said before the commission envisaged making formal and official proposals and so <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further on the commission proposal while <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have the official proposal of the commission. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>predict</span> what is likely or <span class='negation'>not</span> likely to be decided tomorrow by the european commission. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> undoubtedly had excess liquidity -- <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to paraphrase, or to read what <span class='subject'>i</span> said again, but <span class='subject'>we</span> really have to look carefully at m3 growth which remains resilient, as you have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>well, on the first point, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> an interest rate cut. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> a cut, <span class='subject'>i</span> said that <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> that what <span class='subject'>we</span> had observed was in line with <span class='subject'>our</span> definition of price stability. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the italian intention, but <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the estonian decision. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to qualify the situation in other parts of the world, but it also seems to be reasonably true for other major economies in the world, notably for the sister economy <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>but, on the first point, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> call <span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>" legalistic ''. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> remind you that, last month, president trichet said that the possibility of a rate cut was <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the meeting, so the decisions today are <span class='negation'>not</span> something that are out of line with the continuity of analysis and, as the president <span class='comment'>explained</span>, the indicators since then have only aggravated and justified today 's decisions. </p>
<p>but the way to <span class='comment'>react</span> to this is <span class='negation'>not</span> to count on external help that could alleviate the temporary market pressures, instead the real <span class='comment'>answer</span> is actually to count on the countries ' capacity to reform themselves with the right economic policies -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> listed them before, in response to a previous question. </p>
<p>now <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='comment'>told</span> it 's $ 1.20, okay, but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> about levels of exchange rates anyway so... </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have a clear memory that the imf said" you should <span class='negation'>not</span> do that '', and the oecd said" you should <span class='negation'>not</span> do that '', and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have many memories of editorialists, either the major international media or the national media, <span class='comment'>telling</span> <span class='subject'>us</span>" you should do that ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on specific banks, but monte dei paschi has <span class='negation'>not</span> been resolved at all. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span>, of course, that at the time an overwhelming majority of executive branches thought it useful to say that <span class='subject'>we</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> do that. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know what will happen in the forthcoming days, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> in terms of a compromise, but if there are ways to extract certain definitive and well-defined commitments from the governments concerned, that might replace the early warning. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span>, of course, on the exchange rate. </p>
<p>the biggest advance that <span class='subject'>we</span> made in the early 1990s was basically to <span class='comment'>tell</span> banks that they could do both, so the issue was <span class='negation'>not</span> even <span class='comment'>considered</span> at that time. </p>
<p>as far as <span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>remarks</span> in london are concerned, there is <span class='negation'>not</span> one word of these <span class='comment'>remarks</span> that had <span class='negation'>not</span> been <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the previous governing council meetings. </p>
<p>so there was <span class='negation'>not</span> one word of these <span class='comment'>remarks</span> that surprised <span class='subject'>my</span> colleagues. </p>
<p>it has <span class='negation'>not</span> been thought about and it is <span class='negation'>not</span> being <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, <span class='negation'>not</span> only because <span class='subject'>we</span> are proud of <span class='subject'>our</span> own independence, but also because they might <span class='negation'>not</span> even want to know. </p>
<p>and you would certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> want <span class='subject'>me</span> to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you what to write. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>not</span> only for the mro -- as <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>explained</span> in the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span> -- <span class='negation'>not</span> only for the one-month refinancing operation, but also the three-months allotment. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the observation of market participants. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> should <span class='negation'>not</span> have to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you again how attached <span class='subject'>we</span> were to the idea of implementing the stability and growth pact strictly, fighting -- as <span class='subject'>we</span> did in 2004 and 2005 -- for the pact to be preserved, and <span class='negation'>not</span> to be weakened. </p>
<p>today <span class='subject'>i</span> have said a number of things and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to repeat the five points that <span class='subject'>i</span> made in <span class='comment'>responding</span> to one of the first questions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>on the second point <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p>on the latter issue, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you anything. </p>
<p>and clearly, what <span class='subject'>we</span> have to do now -- and this is <span class='negation'>not</span> a <span class='comment'>remark</span> just for europe, but for all the advanced economies of the entire world -- is to preserve, reinforce and consolidate the authority of the public authorities. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> again about the possibility that inflation on average might turn out higher than 2%. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>reacting</span> to anybody 's <span class='comment'>remarks</span> in this area and you will have noted that the word" exchange rate '' did <span class='negation'>not</span> appear in today 's statement. </p>
<p>in ottawa, on the exchange rate of the euro: <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> regard it as very likely that the exchange rate of the euro will be <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the communiqu√© that will be issued after the g7 meeting. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> indicate a specific date when it will be <span class='comment'>discussed</span>. </p>
<p>it will undoubtedly be <span class='comment'>discussed</span> at one of the forthcoming meetings, but what the result of that discussion will be, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>predict</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> even <span class='comment'>consider</span> the issue in the governing council today. </p>
<p>of course, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> that question because - and <span class='subject'>i</span> keep on coming back to it - <span class='subject'>we</span> have to interpret the movements in m3 in a totally new environment and with totally new time series with great caution. </p>
<p>so, from that you might derive that <span class='subject'>we</span> are indeed <span class='negation'>not</span> inclined to try to fine-tune the economy with monetary policy, or to give fine-tuning <span class='comment'>answers</span> to short-term developments. </p>
<p>as for energy markets, although these were <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today, <span class='subject'>i</span> do hope that the summit in barcelona will give further impetus to the privatisation and liberalisation of the energy market. </p>
<p>you will allow <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the qualities of all the candidates that are being put forward to succeed mr. noyer. </p>
<p>you need to have a qualified individual with experience in monetary and financial fields, and the rest is a matter of judgement, on which <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know the <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p>regarding sterilisation, you should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>assume</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> going to sterilise or that <span class='subject'>we</span> will sterilise -- you have to understand, these operations are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>about the exchange rate, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> know how much it 's trading but <span class='subject'>we</span> 're <span class='comment'>talking</span> about the $ 1.18. </p>
<p>there is one big difference between the first and the second ltro, which <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>. </p>
<p>comparisons by country are actually appropriate up to a point, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about the 430 small german banks -- incidentally <span class='subject'>i</span> would love to review the places, the towns and villages where these banks are, but <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> do it because often they would probably be the only bank in town and so they could be recognised. </p>
<p>having said that, it would <span class='negation'>not</span> be proper for <span class='subject'>me</span> to make <span class='comment'>comments</span> about something that is currently unfolding. </p>
<p>on the second point, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> because of the reasons <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>explained</span> before. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> tightening the collateral rules and they can be much looser. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> tightening the collateral rules. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you the name of the newspaper that wrote this, but <span class='subject'>i</span> think they know who they are. </p>
<p>of course, <span class='subject'>i</span> say" gradual '', because given the seriousness and the gravity of the previous situation, you would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>expect</span> such a change to take place all of a sudden. </p>
<p>but it was <span class='negation'>not</span> a <span class='comment'>comment</span> that was meant to infringe upon the independence of the governing council, <span class='subject'>i</span> am absolutely sure of that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>address</span> the aspects that relate to liquidity and funding, and <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> and do <span class='negation'>not</span> want at all to replace either the fiscal actions of the governments or to <span class='comment'>address</span> a possible lack of capital held by the banks. </p>
<p>now that <span class='subject'>we</span> have had still further and sustained increases in oil prices and a prolonged or protracted period of a relatively weak euro, which is <span class='negation'>not</span> in line with the fundamentals, <span class='subject'>we</span> have come to the conclusion that it may take somewhat longer than the two to four months <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> earlier before price inflation comes back to levels at which <span class='subject'>we</span> would want them to be. </p>
<p>the main reason why <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you whether there was a vote today, is that if <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you today then <span class='subject'>i</span> would have to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you every two weeks. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> come to a decision on that, so that <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>second, the risks that <span class='subject'>i</span> listed on behalf of the governing council will <span class='negation'>not</span> surprise you ; there is the stronger pass-through of past oil price increases than previously <span class='comment'>anticipated</span>, and that remains a risk. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on market expectations. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think that <span class='subject'>our</span> analysis is clear enough to permit markets to make up their mind, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> more on that. </p>
<p>this does <span class='negation'>not</span>, of course, change the order of magnitude of the most important counterparts that <span class='subject'>i</span> had <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> -- credit to the economy and in particular credit to the private sector, which is extraordinarily dynamic. </p>
<p>and, again, it does <span class='negation'>n't</span> change the order of magnitude of m3, but it <span class='comment'>explains</span> part of the jump <span class='subject'>we</span> have observed in the most recent months. </p>
<p>as regards your second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you in advance because <span class='subject'>i</span> am absolutely incapable of <span class='comment'>telling</span> you in advance what <span class='subject'>our</span> staff will produce as regards projections. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see why <span class='subject'>i</span> should <span class='comment'>tell</span> you right now what <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>tell</span> <span class='subject'>our</span> japanese friends, <span class='subject'>our</span> us friends, <span class='subject'>our</span> uk friends and <span class='subject'>our</span> canadian friends when <span class='subject'>we</span> meet in essen. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> again on the relationship between the bank of japan and the executive branch in tokyo. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on votes. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on what is done on the other side of the atlantic. </p>
<p>also, one can <span class='negation'>not</span> deny that monetary policy can <span class='negation'>not</span> do everything -- governments have to do their bit in terms of undertaking complete fiscal consolidation and implementing structural reforms and, as <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the introductory statement, the banks have to improve the resilience of their balance sheets, because that is essential for credit and for lending. </p>
<p>now, let <span class='subject'>me</span> say offhand what was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> ; what was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> was the sequence. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the exchange rate. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on a particular level. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> in a position to say that because as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the first part ; namely the actual numbers for what the app programme is going to be in next year. </p>
<p>on the question on whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> it -- <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> clearly the situation and <span class='subject'>we</span> envisaged advantages and inconveniences associated with the possible decisions <span class='subject'>we</span> could take. </p>
<p>when bulgaria has entered the european union, then the first question which will perhaps be asked of the ecb will be whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> it is opportune to enter the exchange rate mechanism, and <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> in advance, so <span class='subject'>i</span> can only confirm what <span class='subject'>i</span> said. </p>
<p>on the first question, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> sure that the figure that you <span class='comment'>mention</span> is the appropriate figure if it refers to growth this year. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that point today. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='subject'>we</span> are satisfied. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>tell</span> you what <span class='subject'>we</span> will do. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> a rate cut today. </p>
<p>on the second point, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p>on your first question, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> is that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on levels of the exchange rate. </p>
<p>why has <span class='negation'>n't</span> the euro area, or more generally, europe, been able to come up with a situation which could be <span class='comment'>considered</span> as, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say as normal, in this situation, as an ordinary situation? </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> mean, exit strategies are really a high-class problem, and <span class='subject'>we</span> 're really far from that, so <span class='subject'>we</span> 're <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussing</span> anything about that. </p>
<p>on the rest, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> really. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on the likelihood of these events. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this as far as <span class='subject'>i</span> know. </p>
<p>again, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>speculate</span> on this. </p>
<p>well, frankly, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> if <span class='subject'>we</span> want to raise rates. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the reinvestment policies you have noted ; <span class='subject'>we</span> will <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it in the future meetings. </p>
<p>it 's a new instrument of monetary policy that will be used for contingencies that <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> see now, and that 's what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span>. </p>
<p>now, of course the second question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span> given what 's been said at the beginning ; that <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> taking questions on a court case that 's pending. </p>
<p>on the first question, tapering: <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really <span class='comment'>discussed</span> policy options because this meeting has been in a sense thoroughly prepared through very good and intense work by the committees of the national central banks and the ecb. </p>
<p>so far, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to say anything more than that because <span class='subject'>we</span>, frankly, did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that other than in the terms that <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> to you. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think actually you asked two questions to get one <span class='comment'>answer</span> ; that it really does <span class='negation'>n't</span> pay at all to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the existence of something that 's irreversible. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> decided, so <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it in one of the future meetings. </p>
<p>on the first question, it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> so <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>not</span> in a position to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the situation of specific countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on bank of england decisions, which <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sure are excellent decisions in the context of the uk. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to give you an incorrect <span class='comment'>answer</span>. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> anything else. </p>
<p>but, as you have said yourself, there is a commitment <span class='negation'>not</span> to apply it if <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> it <span class='negation'>not</span> to be appropriate. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> gave you that information but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> this question. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> are a new institution, which was ten years old, and <span class='subject'>we</span> were <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>considered</span> particularly clumsy at that time. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> certainly will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on such a question. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on its reaction and particularly <span class='negation'>not</span> on its reaction -- whether up or down -- in real time. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> to this question. </p>
<p>it 's <span class='negation'>not</span> so, it does <span class='negation'>n't</span> affect the neutrality of the purchases -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll <span class='comment'>tell</span> you the reasons why you observe these deviations. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>responded</span> ; <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> cutting the link. </p>
<p>in this sense <span class='subject'>our</span> monetary policy accompanies the recovery, as <span class='subject'>i</span> had chance to say in a speech some time ago -- but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> the link. </p>
<p>as regards your last question <span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>respond</span> immediately. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>not</span> sure <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>answer</span> the second question. </p>
<p>but as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> further because <span class='subject'>we</span> are in the course of assessing this letter and preparing <span class='subject'>our</span> response. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>talking</span> about deep existential differences. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on future decisions. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on anything of the kind of the quantum of rate increases, at a certain period of time. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> particularly happy because they are <span class='negation'>not</span> materialising, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that it is exactly what should be observed. </p>
<p>in the present particular case, even if the governing council did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> that, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say that it does <span class='negation'>not</span> seem to <span class='subject'>me</span> in line with what would be appropriate. </p>
<p>what <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>told</span> you concerns may, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> more on that. </p>
<p>but it was <span class='negation'>not</span> that easy at the time, <span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='comment'>tell</span> you from <span class='subject'>my</span> personal experience. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on <span class='comment'>comments</span>. </p>
<p>on the second point, <span class='subject'>my</span> own observation is that the market sees what has been done by governments and what is new and was <span class='negation'>not</span> incorporated in the previous reaction of some market participants, but was carried out by the european executive branches as <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> in the previous question. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the bis <span class='comment'>remarks</span> but, as you know, in <span class='subject'>our</span> own proposal made to the van rompuy task force, <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> explicitly that <span class='subject'>we</span> thought that it would be good to have an independent institution, preferably within the commission, that would make an assessment and diagnosis of the fiscal situation of the various countries that are members of the eu and the euro area. </p>
<p>as you know, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> that in <span class='subject'>our</span> proposal, and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think it would be opportune. </p>
<p>on your first question on the stress tests, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> know whether, implicitly, the banks that are <span class='comment'>talking</span> to you are suggesting that the stress tests should be much tougher -- <span class='negation'>not</span> only to stress test the risks that have already been identified, but all the very many risks that have <span class='negation'>not</span> been identified. </p>
<p>but it is <span class='negation'>not</span> something that <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='comment'>examined</span> today. </p>
<p>that does <span class='negation'>not</span> mean that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> in <span class='comment'>touch</span> permanently and certainly that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> in <span class='comment'>touch</span> in the constituency of central bankers. </p>
<p>as you might recall, these do <span class='negation'>not</span> all <span class='comment'>assume</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> would embark on the administrative regulation of these particular highly-leveraged institutions, but rather on a number of very important indirect moves with the full involvement of the core intermediaries, namely the prime brokers that are themselves under the jurisdiction of the banking surveillance authorities. </p>
<p>as regards your first question <span class='subject'>i</span> would only say, as <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said, that <span class='negation'>not</span> all of <span class='subject'>our</span> introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span> are alike. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span>" accommodative ''. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> would say that there is an ongoing meditation, <span class='negation'>not</span> only at the level of the governing council, but also at the level of the staff of the eurosystem, to see exactly what the situation is and to <span class='comment'>respond</span> to a situation which is also objectively moving. </p>
<p>activity in the secondary market has <span class='negation'>not</span> increased as much as <span class='subject'>we</span> would have liked, but <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>expected</span> that this would be the case. </p>
<p>as regards your third question <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the quarterly results of various institutions. </p>
<p>at this stage <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> further. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> greece myself when <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>explained</span> what <span class='subject'>we</span> had decided. </p>
<p>from today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of <span class='subject'>our</span> measures to growth and inflation, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> ca <span class='negation'>n't</span> really <span class='comment'>comment</span> on one view. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> really thought or <span class='comment'>talked</span> about helicopter money. </p>
<p>on the other point about negative rates, let <span class='subject'>me</span> just say again what <span class='subject'>i</span> said at the very beginning: from today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of <span class='subject'>our</span> measures to growth and the return to <span class='subject'>our</span> price stability objective, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce further rates. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> both <span class='comment'>tell</span> the banks that in the past they took very abnormal risks, exhibited abnormal behaviour and so forth, and then <span class='comment'>tell</span> them now to forget about their risk appreciation and their judgement. </p>
<p>one can <span class='negation'>not</span> really <span class='comment'>talk</span> about a ` bargain ' as <span class='subject'>i</span> 've read in some parts, a ` grand bargain '. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are experiencing a protracted period of high inflation, because of a number of factors which are <span class='negation'>not</span> under <span class='subject'>our</span> own control and, amongst those factors <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>mention</span> <span class='negation'>not</span> only oil, commodity and food prices, but also a number of decisions that have been taken by the governments, and also by the parliaments, in a number of countries. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>not</span> said that and <span class='subject'>we</span> will continue to <span class='comment'>examine</span> the situation and look very carefully at all the information <span class='subject'>we</span> are getting from the markets. </p>
<p>when <span class='subject'>we</span> know that the present market correction is influencing all of the economy, including the real economy, it would be paradoxical if <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>examine</span> the financial sector carefully, when it has such an influence on the real economy. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on whether the market itself understands clearly what has been said. </p>
<p>first of all, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> myself on spreads or on the evolution of the market, and <span class='subject'>i</span> take it that your <span class='comment'>remarks</span> are an observation of what is going on. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> because <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> read that. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before, <span class='subject'>we</span> think, and <span class='subject'>we</span> have numbers that show -- and the vice-president is particularly well documented on this -- that the aggregate profitability of the banking system has <span class='negation'>not</span> been hindered by the experience <span class='subject'>we</span> had of negative rates, and he can <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that at great length. </p>
<p>as regards france, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span>, and the governing council does <span class='negation'>not</span> have a position on the french reform. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that new information has arisen that would change <span class='subject'>our</span> judgement. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> parameters or limits, anything today. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> there yet and that <span class='comment'>explains</span> the difference in <span class='subject'>our</span> stances, basically. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>my</span> responsibility is to convey the decisions of the governing council, <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual statements. </p>
<p>on the first just let <span class='subject'>me</span> <span class='comment'>answer</span>, saying that there were two issues that were <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> today -- well, probably many others -- but as far as relevant to <span class='subject'>our</span> today 's decisions, two. </p>
<p>but there was another thing <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span>: tapering. </p>
<p>second, on the point more generally <span class='subject'>i</span> 'm <span class='negation'>not</span> going to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on individual statements. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> have the exact figures to hand right now, but when you asked <span class='subject'>me</span> before, <span class='subject'>i</span> remember giving you the figures <span class='comment'>explaining</span> why this is so. </p>
<p>on your second question as <span class='subject'>i</span> said before, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on ecb holdings because <span class='subject'>i</span> want to see what comes out of the eurogroup tonight. </p>
<p>on the second question, <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> in detail, really, but let <span class='subject'>me</span> give you the bottom line of this after some reflection. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> want to <span class='comment'>comment</span> specifically on them -- you know what they are. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> actually did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> alternatives scenarios. </p>
<p>so, <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>reacting</span> mechanistically, <span class='subject'>we</span> are looking at the second-round effects. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the first question because it was <span class='comment'>discussed</span> already. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will certainly <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the figure that you have been <span class='comment'>mentioning</span>. </p>
<p>anyway -- even if <span class='subject'>i</span> had seen it, <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='negation'>not</span> have <span class='comment'>commented</span> on it ! </p>
<p>as regards the uae 's declaration to which you refer, <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> see it, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> on that, it has been made public. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>elaborate</span> too much on these reasons, but publicly, yesterday, on the occasion of the international monetary conference, together with ben bernanke and toshihiko fukui, <span class='subject'>we</span> had <span class='comment'>elaborated</span> on that and <span class='subject'>i</span> had myself said: look, you have perhaps five reasons why <span class='subject'>we</span> are observing that ex ante savings are at a global level superior to ex ante investment. </p>
<p>in the present year, the conditions remain for the euro area economy to grow solidly at rates around potential, so, at this stage, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> project the exceptionally high levels of growth that were observed last year, but <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> have sustained growth at rates around potential. </p>
<p>that is important <span class='negation'>not</span> only because the contribution to growth is important, but because it is a way of coping with what <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> as one of <span class='subject'>our</span> emerging problems, namely the level of capacity utilisation. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> a decision which is a very important one and will be made at the appropriate level, namely at the level of heads of states and governments. </p>
<p>for a long period of time, namely a year and a half, <span class='subject'>i</span> have myself signed communiqu√©s on various occasions, particularly communiqu√©s of the g7, where <span class='subject'>we</span> clearly signalled that the international community thought that it would be appropriate and advisable for a number of currencies belonging to the" emerging world '', and in particular" emerging asia '' -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>mention</span> only one currency, because it was a message which related to a number of currencies -- to move up and progressively take better account of the overall economic and monetary situation. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> really the composition. </p>
<p>well, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this today, really. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='comment'>respond</span> to your first question, and also to mr atkins 's question, because <span class='subject'>i</span> did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>mention</span> that, as regards the survey of professional forecasters, it will be published on 15 may in <span class='subject'>our</span> monthly bulletin. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think that 's the text, that 's what <span class='subject'>we</span> 've <span class='comment'>discussed</span> ; <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>elaborated</span> on that. </p>
<p>as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, what <span class='subject'>we</span> see is that <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens are <span class='negation'>not</span> happy with the present level of cpi or headline inflation -- understandably so -- and that they <span class='comment'>consider</span> price stability to be of extreme importance. </p>
<p>but <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> want to <span class='comment'>anticipate</span> what <span class='subject'>our</span> staff will present next time. </p>
<p>they can trust that <span class='subject'>we</span> will do what <span class='subject'>we</span> have to do and <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>react</span> to, <span class='subject'>i</span> would say, erratic inputs. </p>
<p>now, frankly <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> and <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> -- as <span class='subject'>i</span> said last time, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> even <span class='comment'>discussed</span> when <span class='subject'>we</span> are going to <span class='comment'>discuss</span> it. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on the saying itself ! </p>
<p>to the first question, basically <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> this. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>we</span> give messages, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on rumours. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> think what <span class='subject'>i</span> said last time -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> can confirm that even though <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span>, <span class='subject'>i</span> believe the governing council would be pretty unanimous on that -- is that the capital key will remain the guiding principle. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> can say that since then there has <span class='negation'>n't</span> been one aspect of the banking business that has <span class='negation'>not</span> been <span class='comment'>touched</span> by the regulators and the supervisors. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> 'm sorry, both questions might be in principle very interesting questions but <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> that. </p>
<p>on your second point, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the issue of whether or <span class='negation'>not</span> this would be the lowest level. </p>
<p><span class='negation'>not</span> to <span class='comment'>mention</span> that the 320 million fellow citizens are extremely attached to <span class='subject'>us</span> doing <span class='subject'>our</span> job ; the last survey that <span class='subject'>we</span> carried out -- and <span class='subject'>i</span> already said this publicly -- showed that 78% of <span class='subject'>our</span> fellow citizens <span class='comment'>answered</span> yes to the question:" do you <span class='comment'>consider</span> it important that the ecb is independent from governments in order to deliver price stability? '' </p>
<p>now, <span class='subject'>we</span> have <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> either the" operation twist '' or whether to reinvest in different maturities. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nothing (21)', 'no (200)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>the reasoning is as simple as that: <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> else to add at this stage and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>no</span> information regarding <span class='negation'>any</span> message which may be <span class='comment'>addressed</span> to <span class='subject'>us</span>. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nothing (21)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> particular to <span class='comment'>tell</span> them and <span class='negation'>no</span> particular advice to give them, but <span class='subject'>i</span> am sure that they are doing what is appropriate. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nothing (21)', 'not (1281)', 'beyond (9)'}</b></div><p>at this stage, <span class='subject'>i</span> will only say that <span class='subject'>i</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> think the market is <span class='comment'>expecting</span> <span class='subject'>us</span> to prolong the one-year ltro <span class='negation'>beyond</span> that which has already been decided, and <span class='subject'>i</span> will say <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to discourage this current market sentiment. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nothing (21)', 'not (1281)'}</b></div><p>at the present moment, <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> modify <span class='subject'>our</span> working assumption of a gradual recovery and <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>consider</span> that <span class='negation'>nothing</span> goes against this overall, taking all figures, data, surveys and hard figures into account, and so <span class='subject'>we</span> do <span class='negation'>not</span> change <span class='subject'>our</span> vision. </p>
<p>with regard to addicted banks, <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the question of providing liquidity or the liquidity framework today, so <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> more to say than what <span class='subject'>i</span> have already said, namely that it was an issue that <span class='subject'>we</span> were meditating upon. </p>
<p>may <span class='subject'>i</span> say that the stream is <span class='negation'>not</span> coming from all directions, and <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>we</span> can do <span class='negation'>nothing</span> but continue to execute a transparent and understandable policy and to continue to <span class='comment'>explain</span> that policy by every means <span class='subject'>we</span> have. </p>
<p>it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> in the governing council, so <span class='subject'>i</span> that have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to report in this respect. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> else to add, other than to <span class='comment'>mention</span> that <span class='subject'>we</span> judge monetary policy to be very accommodative and that <span class='subject'>we</span> are exercising strong vigilance, which is also in line with the fact that <span class='subject'>we</span> are <span class='negation'>not</span> saying that present interest rates are appropriate. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> will simply repeat that <span class='subject'>we</span> did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='comment'>discuss</span> the matter and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> further to say. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'nothing (21)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>i</span> reviewed the financial markets developments a moment ago, and <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> put them in the proper context, but <span class='negation'>nothing</span> like boj was <span class='comment'>discussed</span>. </p>
<p>so there is <span class='negation'>nothing</span> new or special that <span class='subject'>i</span> could <span class='comment'>mention</span> in this respect. </p>
<p>there is <span class='negation'>nothing</span> particular that <span class='subject'>i</span> have to <span class='comment'>mention</span> on this now though. </p>
<p>so, it 's just as <span class='subject'>i</span> said last time, <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> new to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you and that would be <span class='subject'>my</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> on that. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to report that <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>consider</span> positive in this respect at the global level, and <span class='subject'>i</span> say that sadly, because <span class='subject'>we</span> are absolutely convinced that it is the openness of the global economy which is one of the crucial factors for global growth. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to add to the <span class='comment'>comments</span> <span class='subject'>i</span> have made regarding the securities market programme. </p>
<p>there is <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to say about what <span class='subject'>we</span> <span class='comment'>discussed</span> and the same applies to the general situation in italy. </p>
<p><span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to add to the introductory <span class='comment'>remarks</span>. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> else to say after having checked with <span class='subject'>our</span> own people here and being in <span class='comment'>touch</span> with <span class='subject'>our</span> friends -- <span class='subject'>my</span> close friends mervyn in europe and also alan on the other side of the atlantic. </p>
<p>there is <span class='negation'>nothing</span> that <span class='subject'>i</span> would like to <span class='comment'>comment</span> on at this stage. </p>
<p>so <span class='subject'>i</span> have <span class='negation'>nothing</span> to <span class='comment'>tell</span> you, except to refer to what <span class='subject'>i</span> have said on previous occasions when <span class='subject'>i</span> have been asked this question. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'reluctant (3)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>as regards greece as <span class='subject'>i</span> said, <span class='subject'>i</span> am <span class='negation'>reluctant</span> to make <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='comment'>comment</span> about <span class='subject'>our</span> intentions because really <span class='subject'>we</span> are watching this negotiation and then <span class='subject'>we</span> will make up <span class='subject'>our</span> mind. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'reluctant (3)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> would also <span class='comment'>tell</span> the european households who are hesitating -- and a number of them are <span class='negation'>reluctant</span> to consume because they fear future possible price instability -- <span class='subject'>i</span> would <span class='comment'>tell</span> them" <span class='negation'>no</span>, <span class='subject'>we</span> are here to ensure that you have price stability and you have your purchasing power protected. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'without (15)', 'any (179)'}</b></div><p>and <span class='subject'>we</span> always look at all parameters <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='negation'>any</span> exception in taking <span class='subject'>our</span> decision, <span class='negation'>without</span> giving this particular parameter that you have <span class='comment'>mentioned</span> more than its share in <span class='subject'>our</span> overall assessment. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'without (15)', 'not (1281)', 'no (200)'}</b></div><p><span class='subject'>we</span> changed the state of the art of central banking and today there is <span class='negation'>no</span> central bank that can move rates or <span class='negation'>not</span> move rates <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='comment'>explaining</span> why. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'without (15)'}</b></div><p><span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='comment'>commenting</span> specifically on that, let <span class='subject'>me</span> say that the overall purpose of that document is to ensure that greece will become a thriving economy in the euro area. </p>
<p>and <span class='subject'>i</span> think <span class='subject'>i</span> will leave it at that, <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='comment'>elaborating</span> further. </p>
<p>the advantage of having decreased both the level of the main refinancing operation and that of the deposit facility is that <span class='subject'>we</span> still have the full corridor going down, <span class='negation'>without</span> having to re-narrow immediately the present corridor for <span class='subject'>our</span> very short-term rates, so that <span class='subject'>we</span> can <span class='comment'>expect</span> the very short term money market rates, particularly the overnight rate, to reflect fully this reduction. </p>
<p>that being said, the working assumption is that the decision that has been taken is implemented fully and rapidly, and it goes <span class='negation'>without</span> saying that if it is implemented fully and rapidly, it would eliminate the reason why <span class='subject'>we</span>, from time to time, intervene on the bond market through the non-standard measures that <span class='subject'>i</span> already <span class='comment'>explained</span>. </p>
<p>let <span class='subject'>me</span> just try to sort of recap, <span class='negation'>without</span> going through - actually, <span class='subject'>i</span> <span class='comment'>expected</span> a question like that, so <span class='subject'>i</span> thought <span class='subject'>i</span> should read through the speech again, but <span class='subject'>i</span> 'll save you from that. </p>
