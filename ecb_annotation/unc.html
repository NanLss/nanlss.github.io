<h1>List of sentences containing uncertainty words in the answer section</h1>
</div>
<body>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-01-07</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>And the causes, well, they <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span>. </p>
<p>Of course, issues <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> that we have not yet discovered. </p>
<p>I was equally happy when yesterday the euro came down again <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> vis-à-vis the dollar in the direction of the value it had right at the start of the conversion, and I 'm equally happy today that again the euro rebounded <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> to a level, when we left the bank, of USD 116.75. </p>
<p>To be quite honest, the teething problems, or birth pangs, or whatever you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to call them, were rather smaller than we had thought at some moment that they <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> emerge. </p>
<p>The operational personnel at the various commercial banking institutions has to get used to the new techniques, even to writing the new instructions to their computer, there <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> they make mistakes which they will learn to avoid in the very near future, but which then cause hiccups in the smooth process of transferring these large payments from one country to another. </p>
<p>Structural problems and the problems which Mr. Noyer has just indicated, the problems that there were mainly the result of human errors and <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> human ignorance. </p>
<p>As you know, exports account for only 10 - 11% of the combined GDP and which makes the impact of exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>variations</span> comparable to those in the United States or Japan. </p>
<p>Harmonisation is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> not the proper word, but they have exchanged their calendars what they foresee to issue, to avoid as far as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to have a lot of issues on the same day. </p>
<p>I did not inform you about interventions, although I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> easily mention a figure, the figure is zero, but then we do not have an exchange rate policy, we have a policy aimed at achieving price stability and we do not have an explicit exchange rate policy or exchange rate aim vis-à-vis other major currencies. </p>
<p>If you <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span> switch over to a real-time gross settlement payment system cross-boarder which, as I indicated, already within three days turns out to be the largest in the world encompassing more than 5,000 credit institutions, it is no wonder that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be some ripples in the water <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> but that 'll settle down. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> add something. </p>
<p>The cause <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also have been some times in the central banking system, but mainly in commercial banks. </p>
<p>But, for the time being, no failure or real difficulty in the system itself has <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> and all problems which <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> so far to have been solved in a relatively short time. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-02-04</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>And we also have to get used to the fact that the impact of exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>variations</span> on the euro area as a whole is far less marked than in the past. </p>
<p>It is only after they have finally bunched all their orders together very much towards the closing time of TARGET that they know precisely what liquidity needs or surpluses they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have. </p>
<p>I can not think of any factor that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> undermine this strong currency. </p>
<p>And, in that context, the ECB will not be in favour of any particular regime on exchange rates which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> force it to put aside the primary objective which the ECB is pursuing, namely internal price stability. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Presumably</span> we will talk about exchange rates and certain regimes that one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> envisage for exchange rates. </p>
<p>But then we also realise that this indeed surprisingly strong performance of the US economy <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, in part, be attributed to temporary factors. </p>
<p>Well I would n't like to engage in <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span>, is the President 's answer. </p>
<p>If there was a development that would strongly <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> from the line in which governments have engaged themselves, our global assessment would have to take that into account, but we can not say more today. </p>
<p>On the interest rate moves of other countries, I can not comment, with the exception that, as the Danish Governor told me, truly, it has become <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for the Danes to lower their official rates partly as a result of the successful launch of the euro. </p>
<p>What we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> simply say is that precise execution of the Stability and Growth Pact is an important element in the global assessment by the ECB of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And then, if we try to measure the underlying rate of inflation, the core rate of inflation - which is difficult, in the various countries it is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> easier to measure -, then you will come to considerably higher figures of price increases. </p>
<p>The fact that we are invited to take part in the discussion will certainly not lead us to leak anything of what any assessment <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been. </p>
<p>In itself, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that to be a temporary factor. </p>
<p>One has to realise that some effects <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also have come from the ending of the General Motors ' strike and, by definition, these are temporary factors. </p>
<p>Only if the euro were thought to be seriously out of line, in view of the fundamental factors, vis-à-vis other countries, <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> there be a need for a desirability of intervention, but I would not put a timeframe on it. </p>
<p>And if I were to answer your questions, I would be engaging in <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span>, so I wo n't. </p>
<p>It had the result that certain payments, large amounts of certain banks, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> either not be paid or not be received, so that those institutions were compelled to take recourse to the lending or the deposit facility. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-03-04</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>Yes, we are doing our utmost to underscore the confidence that the world has in this young form of money, the euro, and we would certainly hope that not only the ECB, but also politics would help us to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in supporting this confidence-building process. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we are well on the way. </p>
<p>And - as on earlier occasions - we, and now also the European Commission, have expressed some concern about the determination of, in particular, the larger countries to adhere to the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact and that in itself has led us to say that one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we see of the upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is a looser fiscal position which you will find in my Introductory Statement, if you read it carefully again. </p>
<p>The results of those efforts to measure the degree of confidence are becoming ever more positive not only in the euro area, but even in some of the" out '' countries and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> think of no means with which we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> publish more than we are already doing and with which we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give more speeches than we are already delivering. </p>
<p>So, of course, in my statement we say that there is a potential <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> involved. </p>
<p>China 's situation <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not be so clear: there are some new developments. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> this is less clear for other countries. </p>
<p>If you take Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, for instance, they are clearly countries in which reforms are being implemented and their economies <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be gradually picking up. </p>
<p>We keep explaining that the nature of that problem is predominantly of a structural nature, the lacking flexibility of markets, both labour and product markets, and that if governments can do anything they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> tackle and, to our mind, they should tackle that cause of the unemployment in the first place. </p>
<p>We have carefully assessed that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and we have come to the conclusion that there are no signs of deflation developing in the euro area as such at the moment. </p>
<p>But then I would like to add that the yield curve has risen <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> and has already become <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> steeper over the past few weeks. </p>
<p>If the movement were to continue, there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be cause for concern. </p>
<p>That was, yes, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that was two weeks ago, and I must confess that I have heard him louder through the media than in direct contact. </p>
<p>We still see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but we still see them both on the up side and on the down side. </p>
<p>That is to say that, even if the US economy is seen to be more buoyant than that in Europe, one can not say that the US economy has in fact helped these countries to recover more than the European economy, because the development of exports has been <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> the same over that period. </p>
<p>And that by itself <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have, let 's say, financed the weakening of the euro or the strength of the dollar. </p>
<p>Of course, as I said in my introduction, we will closely monitor, and keep monitoring, the exchange rate developments, also with a view to their impact on, or the impact they <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on prices, particularly through import prices. </p>
<p>We will come back to that later on when - I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say when the time is right - when actual access to the euro area is about to be negotiated. </p>
<p>And if we came to the judgement that the exchange rate developments are really seriously out of line with the economic fundamentals of the various large areas in the world - Europe and the United States - then we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> react, but I can not elaborate on that any more than I have done right now. </p>
<p>Not only a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for prices. </p>
<p>May I also take this opportunity to say that it is clear that in these countries the rate of development in exports to European countries, as compared with the development of exports to the United States, has been <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> the same over the last two years. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that, after all, there are good signs also coming from these regions, and from the emerging economies in general. </p>
<p>Secondly, the phenomenon that the allotment percentage of the refinancing operations is very low and has even <span class='uncertainty'>tended</span> to become smaller, week after week, is a matter of concern. </p>
<p>But - to mention just one example - one of the criteria was that the inflation rate should not <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> more than 1 1/2 percentage points from the average rate of inflation of the three best-performing countries. </p>
<p>And, of course, the interest rate differentials <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also have something to do with that. </p>
<p>Well, it does make the evaluation and the judgement more difficult, undoubtedly because developments in various parts of Euroland <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be diverging <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>. </p>
<p>The countries I was speaking of are proving to be in a better shape, i.e. countries that had negotiated a programme with the IMF some time ago and that have implemented that programme, so that first results of this policy are <span class='uncertainty'>appearing</span>. </p>
<p>But what we are investigating is that there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be another related matter. </p>
<p>The weakening of the German economy which has been evident over the last quarter of 1998 <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, of course, have an impact on its surrounding partners, including - as you asked so specifically - Eastern Europe. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-04-08</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>So, in itself, that rate of growth of credit, which is already moderating <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, is not a cause of inflationary concern for us, and neither is the move today any inducement to the banks to be more forthcoming in giving credit. </p>
<p>And what I said today is that the present situation and the prospects for the increase in the rate of inflation are such that they <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span>, for as far as we can look forward, also to remain well below that ceiling of 2%. </p>
<p>But we know all the different views and so, finally, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> conclude as follows: the Governing Council decides that the main refinancing rate will be lowered from 3% to 2.5%. </p>
<p>I am not going to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about a potential recession if we do not see one coming. </p>
<p>No, on the contrary, as you know, the development of credit to the private sector has been quite buoyant over the past few months, although its bias of increase has come down <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this rate cut, otherwise we would not have done it, will not pose any additional threat of inflationary pressures arising either in small or in large counties. </p>
<p>We see some <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside, i.e. mainly the impact of rising energy prices, but that is by definition, as it was when it was on the downside, a temporary factor. </p>
<p>We wanted the move to be as convincing as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and we were afraid that a smaller move would only have led to further expectations for the future, that this would only be a first step in a series. </p>
<p>We see some <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> deriving from some wage settlements here and there in Europe, those are the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>No, we also see no <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation emerging. </p>
<p>So I will not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about what we would do if there really were a recession. </p>
<p>We have by all means <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> tried to avoid that impression. </p>
<p>The last time I was here, I reported that credit to the private sector was growing at an annual rate of <span class='uncertainty'>nearly</span> 10% ; the latest figure we have now is that it has come down to a rate of slightly over 9%. </p>
<p>In very parochial words, I am inclined to say - and I can not say" do not quote me '' here, I realise that - but I am inclined to say that we moved from 3% to 2.5% which is <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> a slightly, <span class='uncertainty'>unexpectedly</span> large fall, but I would like to add, and now you be sure: this is it. </p>
<p>We see some downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> from a rather subdued outlook for general economic development in the entire euro area. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-05-06</b>, 14 sentences</p></div><p>But as for the impact on the euro, as you have mentioned it, it is true to say that the news that comes by the hour on the conflict in Yugoslavia has an impact on the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the euro. </p>
<p>Just when I was entering this room, there was a statement by the Vice-President of the United States, which immediately caused the euro to lose a couple of hundredths of a percent, but then, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span>, there already is another statement which goes in the other direction. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is too early to assess what the basic reasons are that the euro has been, let me call it, recovering so strongly in the last few days. </p>
<p>So, the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> has increased. </p>
<p>So, I am still not concerned, but have seen with some appreciation, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> even use this term, the recent appreciation of the euro. </p>
<p>So, that is what we discussed and what we decided to emphasise, which is not a change of policy, only a confirmation of policy which <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> did not come across sufficiently well. </p>
<p>In the future, it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> lead to a re-arrangement of priorities within budgets. </p>
<p>At an earlier stage we already indicated that there were instances where wage settlements <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have been concluded well in excess of the likely rise in productivity and that itself is one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we see for the future. </p>
<p>For the time being, we think that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> very well be that the allotment ratio will come up again, to a certain point of equilibrium, but it is not <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to make a final judgement. </p>
<p>But it is not enough of a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to make us concerned about the future inflationary developments. </p>
<p>And in all cases in our history, which is admittedly not a long history, we have easily been able to reach a consensus about our views and, of course, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> someone enters the discussion with a view which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from the view that is being held at the end of the discussion. </p>
<p>But we were <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> concerned that it had been alluded in the European Parliament that we were following a policy of neglect vis-à-vis the euro, so that we deliberately wanted to contradict that. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> they will be there in their traditional role, which is still their role and will remain their role, as the main economic advisor of their government and, to that extent, I have no objections whatsoever, and I have no inclination to be present either. </p>
<p>There is no way to define or discover, at least I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not do that, a split in thinking or differences of views which are of any significance. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-06-02</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say that, to tackle the major problem that Europe has, i.e. the high level of unemployment, given that it is caused only partially and to a minor extent by cyclical factors and to a major extent by insufficient flexibility in the markets for labour, goods and services, call urgently for precise measures that <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from country to country to increase the flexibility of the labour market and to increase the flexibility of the markets for goods and services, e.g. opening hours of shops, etc.. </p>
<p>First of all, the issue of intervention was discussed only to the extent, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> disclose something of the meeting, that I asked what should I answer if a journalist asked me" have there been interventions? '' </p>
<p>All the other south-east Asian countries <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be crawling out of the trough. </p>
<p>These movements are quite normal ; they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have something to do with government purchases of military equipment abroad or whatever things have to be paid. </p>
<p>The stabilisation, though to a different extent, we see in Latin America and the continued - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I add, <span class='uncertainty'>unexpectedly</span> - strong growth in the United States are all factors that make us conclude that the conditions for a recovery are in place. </p>
<p>In that way, as it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span>, it is bearable from the budgetary point of view. </p>
<p>All that we can do about this is to give statements, as we have done today, whatever the repercussions in the political arena <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have tried to make some rough estimates - while the war is still going on - of what the cost <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>What happened today is simply that I was aware of the fact that it had been agreed to release the statement on interest rates for the next two refinancing tenders at 1:45 p.m. and, actually, the member of the staff who put it on the Web site <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> had his watch set wrongly, so he inadvertently, and I apologise for that, already put it on the Web-site at 1:40 p.m. </p>
<p>Regarding the level of reserves, we have recommended to the EU Council, for the time being, to double the amount of reserves, but leaving the question open whether in the future so-called" further - further - calls '' of reserves <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be made. </p>
<p>The actual indications are that we see no reasons to <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> substantially from the European Commission 's forecast. </p>
<p>But, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I repeat what I have said before elsewhere in public: if this were to become a trend across Europe, then there would be a real reason for concern. </p>
<p>Given that there has been a relatively sharp increase in long-term interest rates in the United States, that itself has its spill-over effects in Europe, also causing long-term rates in Europe to rise <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, which - by itself - is normal. </p>
<p>But that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be qualified as a structural factor in as far as the crisis would have lasting effects. </p>
<p>These very short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> movements in the exchange rate, I am inclined to play them down. </p>
<p>Your first question was:" do I regard it as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that the exchange rate would reach the level of one to one to the US dollar? '' </p>
<p>Now, as far as devaluation is concerned, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I repeat what I said: the euro is a currency which is firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger external value. </p>
<p>I will not join in the <span class='uncertainty'>speculative</span> mood that <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be vivid around the world. </p>
<p>In the precise wording of the Finance Ministers ' decision, if you refer to Italy, it contains the explicit warning that reaching the objective of 1% of GDP in 2001 <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> require additional corrective measures on a larger scale than envisaged. </p>
<p>No, we all agreed that we have to make quite an effort to speak with" one voice '' because the song we are singing does not <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> at all, but we <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> need some repetition to achieve full harmony. </p>
<p>Now it is a temporary factor that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> temporarily lead to <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> higher inflation, but it is our view that over the medium term - I am looking toward the end of the year 2000 at least - the average rate of inflation will remain relatively low. </p>
<p>There are, of course, other factors which I did not mention, i.e. the war in Kosovo, which certainly also has a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> different impact on the euro than on the US dollar. </p>
<p>By that I mean that the crucial thing is that we <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be achieving our aim, which is to maintain price stability. </p>
<p>The one I saw <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to be in a quite happy mood. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a slight increase due to temporary factors which are, in particular, the rising energy prices that are working their way through to the price level. </p>
<p>So, I will not comment on any such <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-07-15</b>, 20 sentences</p></div><p>And that is, under the new circumstances, <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more difficult than it used to be in the past before the euro was created. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Somewhere</span> in the air <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span>. </p>
<p>But, if money and credit growth increases further, a re-assessment <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be appropriate. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> add that the start of production yesterday was a total success in all printing works. </p>
<p>And, as your colleague had already concluded from the Monthly Bulletin, there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been some slight change in tone that was confirmed today in my statement, and we will monitor the developments in the months to come very carefully. </p>
<p>Yes, we do intend to be as open and transparent as we <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> can. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the euro is firmly based on internal price stability and, therefore, has the excellent potential to achieve a stronger, external value. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> interpret that, not as a bias, but as a bias gradually creeping into our considerations. </p>
<p>But the real answer is that it has not been found, but it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not have been used, because it was not final. </p>
<p>But it is not pointing at a specific <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a breach in specific countries. </p>
<p>Well they have <span class='uncertainty'>differed</span> in various Member States. </p>
<p>It looks more at the medium term and at the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> arise if a number of improvements are not pursued and if there are adverse developments in the medium or long term in, for instance, the real economy. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be helpful for governments to have a number of technical analyses in looking at their own fiscal stances. </p>
<p>But it is not pointing at certain countries in saying that there is a special <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of breaching the 3%. </p>
<p>In the ultimate series the word" EURO '' will still be there in Greek letters, but it will be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> shadier than in those published earlier. </p>
<p>Not because there is any <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> consequence, but because we have the technical knowledge and habit of doing this with the help of all the national central banks of the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this was an appropriate decision at the appropriate moment and, of course, the effects of monetary policy decisions will become evident only with a very long time lag. </p>
<p>So it can not be concluded from this that there is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>But it does not point to any <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of such a development in the short term. </p>
<p>All I can say is that circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> change and I have already answered the question about the bias, using the word" creeping in ''. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-09-09</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>It will undoubtedly be discussed at one of the forthcoming meetings, but what the result of that discussion will be, I can not <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span>. </p>
<p>I am not reacting to anybody 's remarks in this area and you will have noted that the word" exchange rate '' did not <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in today 's statement. </p>
<p>We are not moved by the day-to-day <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuations</span> in economic <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> as we see them, as I also indicated in my statement. </p>
<p>And it is not sure to what extent the structural and cultural shock of the introduction of the euro <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> itself have changed behaviour and relationships of investors and consumers across the euro area. </p>
<p>The transmission mechanism as such is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> in the dark, I admit. </p>
<p>So, in that aspect, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say that we are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> less activist than some other central banks in the world <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to be. </p>
<p>You must bear in mind that there are two differences between the situation, let us say, in the United States - I am just taking this as an example, and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be any other large economy - and in Europe. </p>
<p>And, having said that, you can also see that it is not related to the interest rate policy conducted, because the marginal lending facility works whatever the interest rate for this facility <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>So, they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase their liquidity value on any given day by a very high factor. </p>
<p>Through the marginal lending facility, if there are <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> needs, on a given day or at a given time of day, from the banking system that have not been covered through tenders, all the banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> immediately come to the Eurosystem and take all the liquidity they need. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to attach greater importance to three-month moving figures than to the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of one-month figures, or even daily figures. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> add that this was deliberate. </p>
<p>I do not think that interest rate policies would have an impact on the effects or the <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> effects of the century date change. </p>
<p>In that case, we can, through the banks and directly, handle any increased demand for liquidity that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> arise. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be a shock, at least in the statistical series, and we must, of course, be prepared to deal with it. </p>
<p>So, from that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> derive that we are indeed not inclined to try to fine-tune the economy with monetary policy, or to give fine-tuning answers to short-term developments. </p>
<p>It 's creeping and it remains creeping - but at snail 's pace, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be a golden opportunity to take further measures both in the sphere of reducing the fiscal deficits and in the sphere of structural measures to increase the flexibility of markets. </p>
<p>One of the reasons was that there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been a special shock related to the introduction of the euro. </p>
<p>Well, the message you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> want to repeat is what I said in my Introductory Statement, namely to continue on the road to increasing flexibility in the labour, product and service markets, to take measures especially in a period when the economy and the economic outlook are brighter than we had foreseen earlier. </p>
<p>We will see if there is a specific demand for liquidity that is clearly related to this period, that will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> show up in the last weeks of this year and the very beginning of next year. </p>
<p>So we are distinctly, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> confirm this, more optimistic now on the outlook of the development of the real economy, both for this year and for next year, than we were three months ago. </p>
<p>We have the instrument available, in principle, to switch to a <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender if we were to deem that necessary. </p>
<p>We can deal with an increased demand for liquidity that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> arise. </p>
<p>But you will remember that, when we made the choice of the monetary policy strategy last year, and we made the choice of the reference value, one of the explanations for calling that a reference value was that we were <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> for many reasons. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-10-07</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do that. </p>
<p>It has gradually strengthened <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, to a level - as it was this morning at 1 o'clock - of about USD 1.0710. </p>
<p>The answer to the first question is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more complicated. </p>
<p>You have to realise that the statement by the fifteen participating central banks implied that they would limit their annual sales of gold to an amount of <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 400 tonnes per year and to an amount not exceeding 2,000 tonnes over the next five years. </p>
<p>We know, <span class='uncertainty'>preliminarily</span>, what the Swiss authorities intend to do, but I would like to emphasise that the Swiss have never announced either when they would start or when they would end. </p>
<p>And we will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> review it <span class='uncertainty'>sometime</span> ahead of the end of the five-year period. </p>
<p>I have seen that your remarks, Christian, which you made in French, <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span> through the translation to adopt quite another meaning and that was a phenomenon which we have to deal with and to cope with. </p>
<p>But we also see signs that it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> accelerate <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> further, but we need further evidence to confirm this. </p>
<p>But what we do see - as far as inflation is concerned, insofar as we pay attention to current developments - is that inflation is slowly creeping up, but - and not <span class='uncertainty'>unexpectedly</span> - due <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> exclusively to the increase in oil prices which is working its way through into consumer prices and which will <span class='uncertainty'>presumably</span> continue to work its way through. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you want to add something because you have also been quoted. </p>
<p>But before taking action we need more conclusive evidence confirming our <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> assessment. </p>
<p>And we are now turning our mind in our medium-term outlook to the future, realising that we have to adopt and to have a monetary policy stance which is conducive to sustainable non-inflationary growth, which is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> different from the accommodative stance we had in a period when we saw output slowing and inflationary expectations or tendencies even going in a downward direction. </p>
<p>But the statement was intended to give some certainty, or to take away <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> - let me put it that way - in the gold market for five years and then we will review it. </p>
<p>But what we do consider is that this deregulation, liberalisation and increasing competition in itself <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be a process which is rather long-term in character - because it is ongoing. </p>
<p>Very specifically, in the English translation in the Parliament the translators used the word" <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span> '' in a certain context, whereas the word" <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span> '' did not <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in the French text. </p>
<p>We see a slow, although not <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>, increase in the rate of inflation. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-11-04</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>What we were sure of is that, whatever the so-called neutral or balanced rate <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be, the level of 2.5% prevailing until today was below it. </p>
<p>However, all indicators, as we assessed them today, - and I am talking about wage demands, I am talking about producer prices, and I am talking about the liquidity situation - point in a direction that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside are increasing and have already increased, i.e. the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of that figure of 1 1/2% to 1 1/2% being threatened. </p>
<p>What I said is that we have come to the conclusion that there is ample liquidity, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> add, very ample liquidity available in the euro area economy. </p>
<p>We want to calm down markets and market expectations without saying anything about whether and when a next step <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be necessary. </p>
<p>I did n't mention it specifically, but, in assessing all the indicators we had, we paid due attention to the fact that in various regions of euro area there <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be an acceleration in wage demands which, by itself, is adding to our conviction that it is about time to raise interest rates. </p>
<p>If we were able to quickly enforce the so badly needed structural changes, as I said, in labour markets, in goods markets, in all kinds of activity in the economic sphere, then we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come to a higher potential growth rate than we are actually seeing now. </p>
<p>We do want to be credible which does n't rule out that, on some occasion in the future, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be forced to surprise markets. </p>
<p>Just as a last word: if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> repeat our leitmotiv, because in our view it is absolutely crucial: provided a number of structural reforms are carried out or pursued in Europe, inter alia in terms of goods, services and labour markets, Europe 's growth potential will be maximised and the employment benefits of growth will also be maximised. </p>
<p>The size <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been a surprise. </p>
<p>You ca n't understand anything because - let me phrase it this way - in our deliberations we were very sure that, had we moved by 25 basis points, we would immediately have created the expectation and <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> in the markets that there would be another step to follow. </p>
<p>And that 's our aim: that growth should pick up in Europe - growth is at different stages in different regions, but <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> everywhere it is picking up - and at a favourable pace which does not generate inflationary tensions, because if that were to happen we should be obliged to take measures to curb it later on. </p>
<p>It was not an issue, but it was one of the factors taken into consideration - co-determining, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> put it that way, the size of the rate increase. </p>
<p>We have tried to explain in advance to the public that it would not be our desire to put a stop to growth at the very moment it was beginning to pick up, but to make sure that this growth <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> remain non-inflationary and hence would have the best chance of lasting a long time. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> happens in practice that in the repetition it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> as if there is an acceleration, which was not our intention, but you can not do anything about that. </p>
<p>So that if we want to see unemployment continue to fall - even fall faster - in Europe, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we are contributing to this end by our decision today, which supports long-term strong growth which avoids the danger of inflationary developments - although this is not a substitute for the carrying-out or pursuit of structural reforms. </p>
<p>That can <span class='uncertainty'>vary</span> from one month to another, of course. </p>
<p>We want instead that growth should be sound, without inflationary tensions so that it will last as long as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and be as strong as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>In some countries, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> four, current inflation rates are over 2%. </p>
<p>But, so far, the countries that have indicated that they are thinking of moving in that direction <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> not to be an overwhelmingly disturbing factor for the euro area as a whole, let me put it this way. </p>
<p>And, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> later, it also means that it will end in the adoption of the euro as a currency for these countries. </p>
<p>And all governors of the accession countries - with the exception of one, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - will come to that seminar and we will discuss a wide range of issues which have to do with legal aspects, statistical aspects, monetary policy aspects of entry to or becoming a member of the EU. </p>
<p>But then I want to repeat - we do want to be predictable, to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, because only in this way can we also succeed in being credible on the markets. </p>
<p>Today, we have both pillars <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span> pointing in the same direction, namely in the direction of an increased <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> towards price stability as we perceive it. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>1999-12-02</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>And the figures, as our statisticians have assured us, are becoming more reliable <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> by the day. </p>
<p>What <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> the motives be? </p>
<p>Yes, I think so - to continue to pursue a policy that is oriented to price stability in the euro area, and with success, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> know, we do not have an exchange rate target. </p>
<p>On the one hand, the exchange rate is regarded as the outcome of the entire economic process and - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I add - the psychological process on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>
<p>Well, let me say what I say ever more often: as a central banker, the one thing I have learnt is not to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on anything, but rather to fight <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> wherever I can. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - if we get that message across and we will continue to do so - that that in itself will underline, as I have already said, our feeling that the euro has a strong potential to appreciate. </p>
<p>So, I am <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> best advised to stop saying anything, although, for once, you have not exaggerated. </p>
<p>So, I will refrain from any <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> - also on this aspect. </p>
<p>If indeed the structural reforms in the labour market, in the good markets, were finally to be implemented throughout the euro area, then we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a potential growth rate, or a growth rate, that is significantly higher than that currently perceived. </p>
<p>Now, what I added today is that if - indeed, also in response to the first question - if potential growth were to rise in the course of time, and if there were convincing evidence that this was happening as a result of structural reforms in the functioning of the various markets, if the potential rate of growth were thus to go higher, then that would also be a reason to <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> our reference value. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> - but it will take time for it to materialise - lead to a smaller growth of M3 in the future. </p>
<p>And, whatever I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say to the German Government, I would rather say to the German Government directly. </p>
<p>The exchange rate - and I can <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> not repeat it often enough - is one of the main indicators forming part of the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy. </p>
<p>On potential growth, if I remember what I said and was reported correctly, I did not say that the potential growth was higher, but that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be higher and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become higher than the trend rate of growth which we observe, which we put at the figure of 2% to 2 1/2% for the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>But we do, of course, have this Y2K effect which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> cause some hickups in the development of the figures. </p>
<p>All I want to say about the recent intervention in Germany - in the company market, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> we call it like that - is that it does not enhance the image which we want to have of being an increasingly market-driven economy across the euro area. </p>
<p>Would you excuse me that I will not join in the <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> on interest rates for the future? </p>
<p>So, for example, the forecasts that were published by the European Commission, although the underlying <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> were <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> slightly different from ours, their outcome was virtually identical. </p>
<p>We, of course, also compare those forecasts with our internal <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> forecasts, which will ultimately be published in the course of next year, as I have often announced. </p>
<p>So, I would point out that the European Commission also forecasts average inflation in 2000 and 2001 to be 1.5%, and we see no reason to <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> from that forecast. </p>
<p>As to whenever and wherever and how we are going to use it, I will not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-01-05</b>, 11 sentences</p></div><p>It <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> has to do with the phenomenon of the completely free single market in goods, services, people and capital. </p>
<p>What we had proposed to the market in a very transparent way was the size that, for us, <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to be consistent with the immediate return to what I call a ` neutral liquidity situation '. </p>
<p>I think we have reason to be satisfied, that we have demonstrated that this new body, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take decisions in time, in an effective way and in <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span> of future developments. </p>
<p>Now, the fact is that the market participants have been more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and asked for less. </p>
<p>And it is a process which will take if not decades, well, then <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> even longer. </p>
<p>Well, I can not quantify how serious the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is. </p>
<p>And then, when I say we were <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> surprised - with the benefit of hindsight, of course, one can explain everything - it is not really surprising that the very different cyclical situations prevailing in Europe and the United States did cause the exchange rate to move in the direction it did. </p>
<p>But I will never exclude that <span class='uncertainty'>sometime</span> this year, or next year, we will use it. </p>
<p>I was <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> surprised, although it is explicable, that the exchange rate then went down further - let 's say - through the level which had persisted throughout 1997 and 1998 and came close to so-called parity with the dollar. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, we would hope that any wage settlement going in excess of the rate of productivity increase <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be avoided. </p>
<p>Some of you, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span>, or other commentators have said so. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-02-03</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>Again, with the benefit of hindsight, we are now of the opinion that that period <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been on the long side. </p>
<p>The size of the increase - I do not know how you want to qualify it - but you should not see it as a bias in any direction you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> think of. </p>
<p>If we had waited, we would have run the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, honestly, of being forced to do more than we are currently doing in the future. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have prepared markets well enough in their, as it so happens, justified expectation that something would happen. </p>
<p>But, looking at the whole of the euro area, I <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> whether your <span class='uncertainty'>prediction</span> will come true. </p>
<p>The main factor is still, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, the different cyclical situations in the euro area compared with the United States, which make it quite normal for the exchange rate to move as it has. </p>
<p>Well, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, regarding our last move of 4 November last year, we deliberately, let me say, massaged the markets in that direction between 15 July and 4 November. </p>
<p>We hope to underscore public confidence by our actions and by an appropriate policy to preserve the people 's confidence in their currency to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>If you listen carefully to or read the statement I made last Monday, the statements the Vice-President and some of my colleagues made in the weeks before that, even the statement we delivered together a month ago, then there were many signs that you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> expect something. </p>
<p>Of course, that is an influence with which we have to cope, but - as I indicated in my introduction - we have the feeling that we are rapidly getting into step with the US economy and that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, and it even should, lead to a - let me call it - more balanced development of the exchange rate as well. </p>
<p>If you are convinced that all indicators, as well as the two pillars on which our monetary policy strategy is based, are already now pointing towards increased <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability - and that does include recent developments in the exchange rate, which can not be ignored and which is one of the main indicators we look at - then we were afraid to wait. </p>
<p>So you can <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> nothing about efforts on our part to try to spend them. </p>
<p>We did and we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the euro has a strong upward potential, for the reasons which I have given to you so often. </p>
<p>As higher oil prices are working their way through and as import prices are higher due to the exchange rate, we do expect inflation in the coming months to continue to increase <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> and to taper off a few months later, so as to remain - on average - well below the maximum of 2% in the year as a whole and in the next year. </p>
<p>But, of course, as I indicated in my introductory remarks, in our decision today, we carefully looked at the recent developments in the exchange rate as one of the main indicators which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a lasting effect on future price developments and which we wanted to counteract. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-03-02</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>You are talking about Italy, I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span>. </p>
<p>That is why I say that there can not be any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anybody 's mind as to the direction of future monetary policy. </p>
<p>And there was strong urging from all sides in the Governing Council that we should see to it that - if we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not speak with one mouth, preferably with one mouth, we should at least let only one voice be heard. </p>
<p>Well, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been said that the Bundesbank intervened, but I can say that the Bundesbank did not intervene. </p>
<p>We did notice that we were widely reported - as reflected in the last but one question - as <span class='uncertainty'>seeming</span> to create diverging views and <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> in markets. </p>
<p>So, I am sorry for not being able to answer, but what is important is that it is not as simple as it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> look. </p>
<p>I would not dare to give a precise figure, but you can not simply base <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> on the difference between the actual outcome of M3 at the end of 1999 and the reference value, because there were special factors at the beginning of the year. </p>
<p>Well, I do not think that my statement of today - as I have said before - can leave any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about what we have been doing. </p>
<p>We know that one party in Tokyo was in the market, precisely at lunchtime, and that caused some <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, but it was not a central bank, I can assure you. </p>
<p>As to the moves Mr. Tietmeyer <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> or will make, passively or actively, I will certainly not comment on this. </p>
<p>What we are strongly interested in, what we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is that - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I paraphrase my American colleague - a strong euro is in the interests of Europe. </p>
<p>But when the image presented is one of disunity, of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, of a lack of strong and unified will, that is never good for a currency. </p>
<p>In Europe we have an economy that is picking up strongly due to the oil prices and the exchange rate itself, with some indications that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation are on the upside. </p>
<p>So, there you see once again, it is the same message, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be interpreted differently in practice. </p>
<p>And there are signals, at least in the demands, that the contracts <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be excessive. </p>
<p>Well, let me say this: on the basis of the statement I have just made, there can be no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anyone 's mind as to the direction in which monetary policy will be moving in the near future. </p>
<p>So that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be held against Sweden in any way. </p>
<p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be that, if the supply increases, the upward movement in oil prices <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be reversed. </p>
<p>But I would just like to give the warning that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be increasing. </p>
<p>And all the members <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> elaborate on that, give explanations in their own words, but the message is the same. </p>
<p>We have already said it 100 times, namely that the Monthly Bulletin, which is issued <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> one week after the Statement of the President, i.e. a statement of the kind the President has just made, is not sending and will never send messages <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> from that in the Introductory Statement. </p>
<p>As to your argument that you have never heard me so hawkish: well, the signs are increasing that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are growing. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to these forecasts are increasing. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> add, much the same to what you have just mentioned for" Le Monde '' also <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span>, if I remember correctly, in the" Handelsblatt ''," Les Echos '' and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> in other sources. </p>
<p>Well, whenever there are <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for a certain currency area - in this case Europe - that have the tendency to weaken a currency - and this goes for the United States and for Europe - there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly be a political impact. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-03-30</b>, 8 sentences</p></div><p>What we do think is that - I want to repeat what I said earlier - the period ahead of us gives all governments, and I am inclined to say the French Government is certainly included, a golden opportunity to speed ahead, faster than <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, towards fulfilling the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>The Council has briefly discussed the phenomenon of asset price <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and the fact that we are extremely hesitant, or reluctant, to pass any judgement or normative judgement on these developments. </p>
<p>And they do <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate that the social partners, in Germany, too, have taken their responsibility for their future, and for their country, very, very seriously. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> I say the same? </p>
<p>It is true to say - amazingly, I must say, basically, also for the US authorities - that the US economy <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be continuing to grow at a pace which - we thought earlier - <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be similar to that in Europe. </p>
<p>Well, first of all, we are not joining investment banks in <span class='uncertainty'>speculating</span> on what either stock prices or interest rates will be doing in the near future. </p>
<p>With regard to the exchange rate: as I have said, the exchange rate has not moved very much since our last meeting, but it has stayed around the level already reached two or four or even six weeks ago, which is a level that the Governing Council firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> does not adequately reflects the potential for growth and the current situation of robust economic growth with unemployment slowly falling in the euro area. </p>
<p>We now think it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even continue to be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> higher than in Europe. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-04-13</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>Well, they contribute to the upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, together with the prolonged period of high oil prices. </p>
<p>Second, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> years later, there will be the required entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the President would like to add something. </p>
<p>So, the exchange with banks in the private sector will be <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for a period of <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> one to two months. </p>
<p>But I am not a prophet and I can not <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> precisely when. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, I would not tell you. </p>
<p>And they <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> diverge. </p>
<p>I can repeat it again: the position, the level of the euro, as it has now been for a rather prolonged period, is a position, which - over time - contributes to the upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Well, <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> it was not. </p>
<p>Many things are happening, but <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> at a very slow and - <span class='uncertainty'>occasionally</span> - at an even disappointingly slow pace. </p>
<p>And, third, again years later, there will be the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> - provided all the convergence criteria, both quantitative and qualitative, have been met - of entry into Monetary Union and also of adopting the euro as their currency. </p>
<p>And this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take a period - well it <span class='uncertainty'>differs</span> from country to country - of, say, up to 30 years. </p>
<p>Let me put it this way: we share the optimism on economic growth, as it has been expressed by the Commission, in that we also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that growth in 2000 and 2001 will be well in excess of 3%. </p>
<p>But, then, one has to remember that the structural reforms necessary in the labour markets, in the product markets, in the goods and services markets, in government finance, in social security systems, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> - and do - <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from country to country, and from region to region. </p>
<p>No, it is true and, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take this opportunity, what you are referring to is the recently published World Economic Outlook of the IMF in which it was said - as far as monetary policy in Europe is concerned - that, admittedly, monetary conditions were ample, but - given the economic situation and the likely development of inflation - there <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to be no need to tighten monetary policy. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> whether anybody else would take an initiative to that effect. </p>
<p>And it is that factor - if those upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> become stronger or if they do not abate - that would induce monetary policy reactions, not the exchange rate as such. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not agree more. </p>
<p>And, whenever we come to the publication of forecasts, we do want to supplement it with, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say, an educational explanation of what forecasts mean and what they can be used for, making clear that they are certainly not the only determinant underlying certain decisions to be taken. </p>
<p>We will not be surprised - on the contrary, to the extent that oil price and exchange rate developments work their way through in the coming months, we do expect, for a brief period in the coming months, that the figure <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> even slightly exceed that of 2%, before dropping back to 2% or less, so that, on average, we are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> less comfortable than the Commission <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to feel. </p>
<p>Whether the high figures that the Commission quotes will materialise gives us some reason for hesitation or <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>On the other hand, all the indications we have given - and I will repeat them again today - are such that I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there can not be any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anybody 's mind as to the direction in which the next move will go. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-05-11</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>Well, if the current exchange rate is compared with the exchange rate for the euro over the period - let us say - two years before the euro came into existence, a period in which growth forecasts, unemployment figures and inflation figures were far - I do n't want to say" worse '' - less good than at present, then the fact that the exchange rate has clearly fallen below that level for some time now indicates to me that it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be that the markets have overshot the level which would be appropriate for an economy which has such a strong growth potential, which is actually realising that potential, which will realise a healthy balance of payments surplus for the foreseeable future and which is realising a climate of price stability - in terms of price increases in the foreseeable future, i.e. over the next two years - which will remain below the ceiling we have defined as the limit for acceptable price movements, namely 2%. </p>
<p>Interventions are always a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> and the only time you will hear me speak about interventions, and the deliberations concerning them, will be at the time we intervene. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on how long it lasts. </p>
<p>First of all, I am not prepared to take any blame for the decline in the euro, although I realise that markets <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do so. </p>
<p>What I merely wished to do was to convey the feeling to the citizens of Europe that they should not be concerned about these exchange rate developments, as they increasingly <span class='uncertainty'>tended</span> to be in view of the value - the intrinsic value - of their money, the euro, and of the intrinsic value of their savings and pensions. </p>
<p>First of all, as far as structural reforms are concerned, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> day after day and press conference after press conference we urge the people, the social partners and governments of the euro area to continue to carry out and implement further structural reforms in the labour and product markets. </p>
<p>Why we have not done so today is due mainly to the fact that in the very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> and virulent markets we are experiencing these days we did not want to instil a new element which would again increase <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or virulence. </p>
<p>We have obviously not done so today and I will not exclude, as I have said before, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of our switching to that technique at some time, some day. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Somewhere</span> I have said that we are remaining very vigilant. </p>
<p>I have read those rumours, just as you have, and I am inclined to do the same as the markets are <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> doing, i.e." shrug them off ''. </p>
<p>Well, the most important question, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> call it that, is the first one, of course. </p>
<p>We are, in fact, concerned - not about a certain level, but about certain developments which have occurred and about the fact that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be fewer automatic stabilisers in that respect than <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have existed in various financial centres before. </p>
<p>We are concerned, but <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I ask Mr. Noyer to express our concern </p>
<p>This is <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> too complicated for me. </p>
<p>We have studied a number of tools that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> permit us to rule out any excessive developments in the same direction. </p>
<p>We are monitoring the situation very closely and we are developing tools that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in due course, if necessary. </p>
<p>It will be denominated in euro, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>And, as long as the ECB is there - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, as long as I am there - there will be no danger. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take another decade before we can speak of one large European capital market. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-06-08</b>, 43 sentences</p></div><p>I think that, very theoretically, maximum bid rates can only work in a situation where there are strong expectations that the central bank <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> wish to cut rates. </p>
<p>For <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rates, by contrast, we had said from the beginning that we wanted to have that tool available and we have studied the various <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> features of this <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate system for many months. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> answer the question first. </p>
<p>So, whatever difference there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be between the average rate of a tender, the marginal rate and the minimum rate, it should be considered in exactly the same way as you would consider the difference between overnight or one-week/two-week rates, as compared with the fixed tender rate. </p>
<p>I should like to remind you that from the outset we had said that we had two <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> tools. </p>
<p>At the marginal rate, the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> allot either 100% or less. </p>
<p>The previous hikes in interest rates <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have had an effect on the turn-around in the sentiment about the exchange rate. </p>
<p>It is purely inspired by the worsening situation in the bidding process, whereby the last two allotment ratios were less than 1% each, at 0.88% and 0.87% respectively, which made it <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> ridiculous. </p>
<p>And the main one is that the higher than expected import prices as a result of higher than expected oil prices, other raw material prices, and the prolonged, depressed state of the exchange rate will work their way through more than <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> two or four months ago. </p>
<p>Now, it is a fact, of course, and it is the experience of many national central banks which used different types of <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tenders before the euro, that market rates normally come close to the minimum rate. </p>
<p>Now, finally, we have found out that the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> way to use it would be relatively close, in terms of signalling procedure, to the fixed rate tender, so that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> shift from one to the other without blurring market players at all, i.e. a combination of the <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender with a minimum bid rate. </p>
<p>It is the market forces that bring them down, it is not a target in the sense that you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say the Federal Reserve has a target. </p>
<p>And, if we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give you a ratio, a mathematical ratio between the weight of the first and that of the second pillar, then we would also be in a position mathematically to reduce the two pillars to one. </p>
<p>So you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> conclude that we did not intervene. </p>
<p>However, I should also add that this switch in no way rules out the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, at some point, return to the fixed rate tender system. </p>
<p>One was fixed rate tenders and the other was <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tenders. </p>
<p>Well, there are many <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> technical devices. </p>
<p>So you <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> losing money. </p>
<p>The yo-yo - no - the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is very high, even in the course of a trading day. </p>
<p>And I would like to reiterate and re-emphasise that this switch to the <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender procedure in no way implies a change in monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>So, by implication, that means that we hope these extra revenues, as they come in, be they from privatisation or licensing of GSM features or from cyclically higher tax revenues, will be used to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to strengthen the process of consolidation of the public finances, in other words, to reduce the deficit and to reduce the burden of debt. </p>
<p>For the fixed rate tenders, we started with the idea that we should be able to provide the market with <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> the liquidity that we thought it needed. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the global amount we want to provide. </p>
<p>When oil prices come down, you will - after a while - also see petrol prices coming down for the consumer, and you even saw that happening by a few cents this week and, when they go up, you see with a lag - which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be several months on average - that these prices work their way through to the consumer price level as well. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span>, on the basis of some forecasts, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even go over that average figure. </p>
<p>So it is just that the signalling effect - even if, theoretically, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be provided by both systems - works well only with a minimum rate system. </p>
<p>The euro has depreciated over the last 12 months at a steady, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> continuous pace - there is nothing yo-yo about that - and that trend now <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have reversed. </p>
<p>And I have actually asked the same question you have just asked me: I asked my colleague from Saudi Arabia that question last weekend, and I got an answer which was as <span class='uncertainty'>vague</span> as that which I am giving you. </p>
<p>But, in a normal stance, where there is no great <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span> in one or the other direction - for very technical reasons, but you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> already have seen that with the fixed rate tender - money market rates are normally on average - that does not mean every day - a few basis points above the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity. </p>
<p>And the reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, some potential for further appreciation. </p>
<p>Admittedly, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be 100% successful, but to my mind, we are increasingly successful in speaking with one voice - both ministers and governors. </p>
<p>To answer the last question first: I said the exchange rate, in my opinion, has - in the past, in recent months - clearly overshot a level which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be regarded as being more in line with the fundamentals. </p>
<p>What ministers can do, and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do at some point, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, is to give general orientations. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> is, but not for the central bank. </p>
<p>But there still is under-utilisation of capacity - the output gap <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be closing, but I would not say that we would want to cap growth in any way at this stage and at this rate. </p>
<p>Well, I do not know what financial markets will expect, but we think with this move we have cleared the horizon, although it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a moving horizon. </p>
<p>And the futures indicate that the oil price <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> at some point fall, but they have already done that for a long time. </p>
<p>And these are the monetary indicators: the forecasts made by others, the development of the exchange rates up until two weeks ago, the development of oil prices - there has been some decline, but an immediate rebound after that - all make us increasingly concerned that, over the medium term, inflation <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> - if we did not act decisively - exceed the 2% limit which we have set for ourselves. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, with this move, combined with the moves we have made since November last year, we will avoid that danger. </p>
<p>This has been much simplified, but I hope it clarifies matters <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>. </p>
<p>For the purpose of giving some clarity to all market players, it is our intention, when we announce the tender, to signal what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the liquidity needs to be. </p>
<p>On the contrary, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the interest rate move of today creates the conditions for a sustained period of non-inflationary but high growth. </p>
<p>I know that the exchange rate of the euro, even after the recent appreciation, does not yet reflect the fundamentals, whatever they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-07-06</b>, 12 sentences</p></div><p>First of all, we are extremely satisfied with our experience of the first two tenders of the <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate type, combined with the minimum bid, which we allowed and announced. </p>
<p>They are based on certain hypotheses regarding so-called exogenous <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> or exogenous factors. </p>
<p>But all the data that have come out also confirm our assessment that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside, rather than on the downside. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our decision of 8 June 2000 to raise interest rates was and still is appropriate in the light of the circumstances and the economic developments as we see them and as we evaluate them. </p>
<p>One thing is <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> as certain, namely that we will publish forecasts, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> towards the end of the year. </p>
<p>But I do not know them yet, so I can do no more than answer your question in these <span class='uncertainty'>vague</span> terms, and certainly not in quantitatively precise terms. </p>
<p>And, looking at the developments of the past few weeks or even months, I would not go along with your statement that the recovery <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have faltered. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - or rather can observe - that this phenomenon has disappeared, and in the first two tenders where market expectations were not moving in any particular direction, the effective rates and the marginal rates have stayed very close to the minimum bid rate. </p>
<p>All indications are, indeed, that developments in the United States are slowing down <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, but I would certainly not qualify this as an external shock, because all indications are that the US economy is in for what we had all hoped for, namely a soft rather than a hard landing. </p>
<p>And it is one of the reasons why we still think that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are on the upside, rather than on the downside. </p>
<p>However, if I already knew the forecasts now, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> just as well publish them now. </p>
<p>The reason for changing to this new system, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> know, was the practice of ever-lower allotment rates, which we had to accept, which made the whole system <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> grotesque features. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-09-14</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>That meeting had been widely publicised and it is true to say that my name <span class='uncertainty'>appearing</span> on the invitation as the discussant had, indeed, attracted quite a number of, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, important representatives from the financial and political community in North America. </p>
<p>The decision on when to do so <span class='uncertainty'>depended</span> very much on market conditions and on technical and tactical considerations. </p>
<p>Now I take issue with the statement that the US economy <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be stabilising at a rate of 4%. </p>
<p>We do think that in the course of the coming two years the growth performance of the euro area will not stay below, and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even go beyond, the growth performance of the United States, remarkably and admirably high as it is. </p>
<p>As to whether it is the full explanation, as you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be implying, there I have my <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span>. </p>
<p>The reserves of both the ECB and the NCBs are entirely and exclusively in the hands of the national central banks themselves and I am inclined to ignore advice such as that which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be coming from the German banking community. </p>
<p>Those estimates <span class='uncertainty'>vary</span> from 0 to 1 percentage point. </p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight we can <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> identify those factors. </p>
<p>But, <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span>, that happened. </p>
<p>Now, it would have been, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, the 50th ECOFIN meeting I had attended. </p>
<p>And I felt that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not breach that commitment, of which I informed the Presidency immediately after I became aware of the forthcoming ECOFIN meeting. </p>
<p>Now, is the liquidity to accommodate <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> second-round effects already there? </p>
<p>As for your third question as to whether the sale of our interest income from foreign exchange has something to do with pressure from financial circles or finance ministers to start interventions, I should like to point out that I can not imagine that you can conclude that the fact that these pressures were there is something of the last few days or <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> the last week. </p>
<p>Our expectation - based on an analysis of what we are seeing around us - is that it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> indeed have proven to be the peak, but we can never be sure. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I have already made those comments in my introductory statement and I have nothing to add to it. </p>
<p>I can always fully understand - but that has nothing to do with my job as a central banker - that governments <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be inclined to alleviate the burden for some and make it even heavier for others or to find room in their budgets by cutting expenditure in order to take countermeasures on account of the weakest categories in society. </p>
<p>However, next Monday you will have another price index figure and our expectation is that you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> indeed have seen the peak. </p>
<p>As long as there are no so-called" general orientations '' being issued by the Council of Ministers, which is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> according to the Treaty, albeit that the Council of Ministers said at the Luxembourg summit three years ago that the issuance of such general orientations would only be considered in very exceptional circumstances. </p>
<p>Second question in the middle: you have to be aware that many central banks - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, in this particular case, including the Deutsche Bundesbank - are in the habit of regularly selling, and have already sold, their net accruals of foreign reserves stemming from their investments in US dollars or yen. </p>
<p>Well, if there is the perception in Denmark that there is an image problem for the euro and that this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have an impact on Danish opinion and on the ultimate outcome of the referendum, I would be happy to try to convince the Danish people that the outlook for the euro area is a very positive one. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I can not be clearer than that. </p>
<p>That I leave to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say I leave it up to the national authorities to come to their own conclusions and <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> even to make these public. </p>
<p>This is common practice, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> daily practice. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-10-05</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>Well, the good of interventions becomes <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> if the results you have achieved are satisfactory. </p>
<p>Well, such exceptional circumstances have not arisen and, therefore, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> justifiably conclude that both the initiative for the interventions and the action itself were fully in the hands of the Governing Council of the ECB. </p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty provides for the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of the Council of Ministers giving so-called general orientations for exchange rate policy. </p>
<p>We will judge that when the time is ripe and the time <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a long time off. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> repeat it, but I can not say different things. </p>
<p>May I interrupt you - <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the answer <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> prevent your second question. </p>
<p>The only surprise that markets and media <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have perceived is the timing. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the monetary policy stance we have adopted today is appropriate to current circumstances, including our assessments of inflation-area developments for the medium-term future. </p>
<p>But I can assure you that there was the maximum <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> degree of consensus of today 's decision that is imaginable. </p>
<p>We have not come to a decision on that, so that I will not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>But the simple fact that the interest rate differential between these two great economic areas, as from today, has narrowed <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> should be a factor helping this development. </p>
<p>And we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the best contribution to maintaining the current climate of robust, even strong growth throughout 2000 and 2001 and even beyond that is to preserve the climate of price stability. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> surprises can not be avoided. </p>
<p>As my colleague, Alan Greenspan, has said," <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> surprises can be an element of policy '' and they have to be. </p>
<p>And the effects that forecasts will have, which will have to be <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> continuously, whereas we will not publish them continuously, is a normal fact of life. </p>
<p>In addition though, I do not deny that the two actions are, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you can say," consistent '' with each other. </p>
<p>So today 's interest rate move was in no way influenced by developments in the exchange rate, except that past developments in both oil prices and exchange rates were longer and more protracted than we had <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> earlier andthey do work their way through orthey threaten to work their way through, both of them, into domestic inflationary expectations. </p>
<p>On the contrary, we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this rate hike and this monetary policy stance create the best conditions for the robust growth which is going on - and with which we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the euro area has more or less reached <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it" cruising altitude '' after the acceleration - and for preserving that cruising altitude for the medium-term future. </p>
<p>In my remarks about fiscal policy and the budget in general, you can indeed derive from them, but to various degrees for various governments, that we are - to say the least - <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> critical of the procyclical stance that <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> from many budgets that have been brought to our attention either confidentially or openly. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-10-19</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>But they do not - given the much smaller energy <span class='uncertainty'>dependence</span> of the euro area economy compared with 20 or 30 years ago - have the impact that would make us change the assessment that we are experiencing, and we are looking forward to experiencing, a period of robust economic growth. </p>
<p>We think that it will take rather longer than we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> only three months ago, when we already knew that there would be a period in which the actual inflation rate would exceed our 2% maximum limit. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> just say that the team that we make up, namely the monetary team of seventeen that met under the chairmanship of Wim this morning, is profoundly and unanimously united behind its President. </p>
<p>The impact of the recent further surge in energy prices leads us to the conclusion that, if they were not to come down quickly, the period during which the actual inflation rates would be over the 2% limit, below which we want them to remain, will be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer than we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> earlier. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this to be a temporary shock to confidence, the significance of which should not be overstated. </p>
<p>But now, given the recent further surge in oil prices, if these prices persist the period will be rather longer than we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> only three months ago. </p>
<p>Still, we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the monetary policy stance that we chose to adopt on 5 October is the appropriate one in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>Yes, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is in the interests of a central bank to be transparent, especially for a new institution, and thereby to be as predictable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I can only say that we strongly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - and in our discussions this morning it was repeated and repeated, and in my introductory statement and also I repeated it - that the euro is undervalued, that there is a misalignment in the currency markets and that there will come a moment at which that will be corrected. </p>
<p>So there has been a dramatic change in global capital flows, whatever the details of the evaluations <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>It is in our interests to be as open and transparent as we <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> can and are capable of being. </p>
<p>I would only mention the fact that foreign direct investment -LRB- FDI -RRB- was - as you have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> - strongly negative in net terms in 1999, but, according to the present figures, -LRB- although of course we have to remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> -RRB-, there has been a reversal in net flows of FDI since the beginning of this year, so that there is an inflow - a net inflow - of foreign direct investment into the euro area. </p>
<p>And we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the recent hesitation in the confidence figures, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> call it that, has to a very large extent been influenced by the incidents, the blockades on the occasion of the rise in energy prices that many European countries have experienced. </p>
<p>One <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that what happened in 1999 was also a number of investments from the euro area to outside the euro area. </p>
<p>We have - I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, in one of our last Monthly Bulletin - given an account of structural measures that have been taken here and there and everywhere. </p>
<p>So I am only referring myself - and it is absolutely right to say that, it was a remark which we made - I am only referring to the accounting of FDI and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is quite factual. </p>
<p>What we would consider before the end of the year would <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the new data that will become available before the end of the year. </p>
<p>As I also said at our last press conference, it can not, by definition, always be excluded that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> be surprises. </p>
<p>I think that this is the main indication that something <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> reverse. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> add, it is more than that. </p>
<p>The implication of that definition is that we have to explain why there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be external shocks which temporarily bring the actual rate of inflation to above this figure, which can at times happen and which we have always foreseen <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen. </p>
<p>Given our assessments of all the forecasts we have available, both internally and from the outside world - from many, many institutions, both national and international - we do expect economic growth to continue at a rate above 3%, both in this year and next year, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even in the year thereafter. </p>
<p>I have seen much <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about that, also in recent days. </p>
<p>So, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we are being listened to, and governments and social partners can be certain that we will not be silent for a long time. </p>
<p>Now, if you study this very, very carefully, you will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> discover that - when you take into account all flows, not only FDI, but also portfolio flows - we are in a slightly better position than before. </p>
<p>We are fully confident that - also taking into account what you said about core inflation, although this is not a concept that we gladly use, but the truth is that, while core inflation has been creeping up <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> over recent months, it is still well within the range of below 2% and that, in the circumstances, we are having a temporary transgression of actual inflation rates, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> last, as I have said, for some time yet - our monetary policy stance, as we chose it to be on 5 October, after seven successive increases in interest rates, is the appropriate one for the present circumstances. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-11-02</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>And the exchange rate as such <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> only have an impact on that mandate if, over time, the exchange rate itself were to be one of the factors undermining our efforts to maintain price stability. </p>
<p>But they are signalling - let me call it - no further <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> from the reference value, but rather some movement in the direction of the reference value. </p>
<p>Now that that differential <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be declining, there is every reason to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that that undervaluation <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, over time, also be gradually corrected. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they are right, as markets <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> always are. </p>
<p>We are still working hard on the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of publishing forecasts in the future. </p>
<p>Well, if anything has changed, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> it is the experience of working together with the Eurogroup, that is the 11 - now already 12 - Ministers of Finance, of engaging in a very constructive dialogue about all our policies, both monetary as well as economic and financial policies, once a month. </p>
<p>Well, originally, about three to four months ago, we thought it would only take <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> two to four months for the higher oil prices and the weak performance of the euro to peter out and gradually disappear from the figures. </p>
<p>Now that we have had still further and sustained increases in oil prices and a prolonged or protracted period of a relatively weak euro, which is not in line with the fundamentals, we have come to the conclusion that it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer than the two to four months I mentioned earlier before price inflation comes back to levels at which we would want them to be. </p>
<p>That means that the extraordinary growth rates which we have seen in the United States for a prolonged period of time and which we and other authorities did not regard as being sustainable in the very long term are coming down from annualised rates of 5 1/2% or even close to 6% per quarter in the direction of lower rates for what <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> - to me - to be a normal and to be expected - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it - soft landing in the United States, which is in the interest of the entire world. </p>
<p>So, although in the beginning I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been a bit sceptical about the significance of such a dialogue, I must say I increasingly appreciate it as a golden opportunity both to hear and to tell our, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call them our political counterparts, what we think of them and what they think of us. </p>
<p>The developments of the euro exchange rate over the last two weeks have - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it - been gratifying and have <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> - but not yet totally, of course - corrected the strong undervaluation of the euro, as we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that this is happening illustrates that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been right in our expectations. </p>
<p>Well, we have always been convinced that the euro will play an increasingly international role over time, but it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a slow process. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2000-12-14</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>We hope it will come, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even think it will come, but it has not come yet. </p>
<p>This, of course, also included the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of a hard landing and the outlook for the world economy as a whole. </p>
<p>And, as I had said in my introductory statement, all available evidence is pointing towards the fact that a period of robust economic growth, be it at a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> slower pace than we have seen in recent months, still lies ahead of us in what we regard as the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>We therefore <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that a growth rate in the order of 3% per year will be maintained in the euro area for at least the next two years. </p>
<p>I mean, the issue you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have in mind has not yet been decided. </p>
<p>On the second question, I can not quantify how serious the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are, but there are always <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability - in one direction or another. </p>
<p>- because that is basically your question - extensively <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> every two weeks. </p>
<p>The main thing I said was that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, as we see them, are on the upside rather than on the downside, but I can not quantify the degree. </p>
<p>And, in the case of Greece, the oil <span class='uncertainty'>dependency</span> or energy <span class='uncertainty'>dependency</span> of the economy is significantly higher than in other areas or in the rest of the euro area. </p>
<p>That feeling of dissatisfaction has disappeared now that the euro <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have turned the corner. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you expand a little on your second question? </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> feel that it has arrived here and there, but, taking a euro area perspective for the euro area as a whole, on all the available evidence we can not as yet conclude that a decisive shift in the trend rate of productivity growth is discernible. </p>
<p>So we are still looking, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that it would be feasible to at least largely overcome that problem, if it were to arise again, with the available solutions. </p>
<p>I will not deny that, in the past, I have been <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> dissatisfied or - how should I say that in English - disappointed with the actual development of the exchange rate of the euro. </p>
<p>If I reflect on the past year, I am always inclined to reflect on the period since the birth of the euro, i.e. a period of <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> two years. </p>
<p>On that basis, I am filled with a feeling of satisfaction in many areas, namely the smooth introduction of the euro, the rapid development of a single money market in the euro area, the rapid developments - which are still going on - in the capital markets in the euro area, and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go on and on with phenomena like that. </p>
<p>The enabling clause itself has - as do all other decisions - to be ratified by all parliaments of the EU Member States and this is expected to take some time - I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is expected that the ratification procedure <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take up to two years. </p>
<p>So, this is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a question which should be raised at a later occasion, once we have new evidence. </p>
<p>This clause would make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the future, if the number of members of the Eurosystem - not of the European Union, but of the Eurosystem - were to increase significantly, to change the procedures of the decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>But, as a central bank we will never, as some other institutions do, create expectations or formulate certain hypotheses about underlying <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> which are crucial to us, like the exchange rate or short-term interest rates. </p>
<p>Thus, the projections will be based on hypotheses which, to be honest, will in all <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> not turn out to be true in the future. </p>
<p>This change <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> then be enacted by a decision of the EU Council in the composition of the Heads of State or Government on a recommendation of the Governing Council of the ECB, which would, in that case, have to be made unanimously and after having consulted the European Commission and the European Parliament or on the recommendation of the European Commission after having consulted the European Central Bank and the European Parliament. </p>
<p>As regards the second question, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you, Christian, say something on this...? </p>
<p>But as different as the circumstances of their respective economies <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be, I can not really see any difference in the actual behaviour of the two central banks. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-02-01</b>, 12 sentences</p></div><p>This, of course, will lead us to <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the outlook for the future. </p>
<p>To the extent, however, that the authority for supervision would be taken further away from the national central banks - this is one aspect of the plans - if true, this would be of the greatest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> concern to all central banks, including the European Central Bank. </p>
<p>That is a model that at least I - I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I can say" we '' - would greatly prefer over the model that is now being <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> in this country - if it is all true - of severing the ties between supervision and central banking. </p>
<p>But I also understand that the latest news about this issue is that ties <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> will not be totally severed. </p>
<p>It goes without saying that, to fulfil that mandate and also the mandate to guarantee financial stability in the system in practice, it is much easier if the ties between supervision and the central bank - and here I mean the national central banks, which are our natural channel of communication to the markets - are as close as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So I do not share the judgement that, over time, we have permitted a tightening of monetary conditions to become <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span>. </p>
<p>But, in general, what we are looking at, of course, is not so much the cyclical developments which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> influence decisions on budgets as primarily the structural developments which are desired. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, although it is true - as you say - that Ireland is without <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> the most, or at least one of the most successful economies in the euro area, the budgetary plans of the Irish Government were clearly out of line with the broad guidelines they had agreed to earlier. </p>
<p>If the tone of my statement today is perceived by you as you describe -LRB- as being more neutral -RRB- then <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> we have managed to strike the right tone. </p>
<p>In that respect, everything is not equal for all countries, but we continue to insist that political endeavour to achieve that situation should remain intact and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that that is not the case in all the countries we are observing. </p>
<p>And so I do have - if <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say so - full understanding for the judgement that has been reached and formulated, be it in very difficult circumstances. </p>
<p>In as far as we already have results of such <span class='uncertainty'>reassessments</span> available internally at the ECB, we expect that the period of robust economic growth - i.e. growth in excess of what we would call long-term potential economic growth - will remain on the cards, so to speak. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-03-01</b>, 9 sentences</p></div><p>We do not see signs that the very gradual slowdown of M3 in the direction of the reference value <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be interrupted in the near future. </p>
<p>So, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the market has understood that well and that the problem has been overcome by the banking sector. </p>
<p>As I said, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be another couple of months before we are there again, after the disturbance which was caused last year by the increase in oil prices and the depreciating tendency of the euro. </p>
<p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have some temporary upward effect on inflation rates, which you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> interpret as an external shock, as was the increase in oil prices last year. </p>
<p>But there was no way we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> technically resolve the problem in its entirety, in other words avoid an increase in the interest rate, unless we had been active on a daily basis in the market by way of fine tuning operations. </p>
<p>When I said that we are confident that we will reach and achieve our mandate of an inflation rate of less than 2% within the next few months and stay there for 2001 and even 2002, that assessment is based on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that interest rates will remain unchanged. </p>
<p>We did provide the Governing Council with an analysis of the events in Turkey and the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of spill-over effects to the euro area, which concludes that such spill-over effects are not to be feared. </p>
<p>We have not come to the conclusion that it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be so significant as to warrant any emergency measures. </p>
<p>By virtue of the fact that we are taking no action at present, you can <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that we are not perturbed by the present state and development of the exchange rate. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-04-11</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>I quoted, in my introductory statement, a range of forecasts - effectively - and not the German ones in particular, which, if I look at the forecasts as we know them - they have not all been published yet - of the IMF, of the OECD and of other international organisations, they all <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the expected growth in the euro area and will, and they will also <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the euro area downwards. </p>
<p>When we look at the precise figure, I think we have signalled three times in the Monthly Bulletin that we were working on the limited, but still <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, revisions of money figures because of one or two factors, mainly the importance of money market instruments owned by non-EMU residents, which should not <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in M3. </p>
<p>It is likely that the figures will have to be <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> slightly towards the end of this year. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> this time it was more like a" canon '' than" in unison '', but the sound was the same. </p>
<p>We have always emphasised that if actual growth was developing at a higher rate than what we call the" trend potential '' growth, then we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> of course accept the development of M3 being higher than the reference value. </p>
<p>First of all, two weeks ago, the situation in the markets was such that we thought it advisable to explicitly co-ordinate our thoughts and statements about the monetary policy situation and monetary policy decisions so that we had an agreed statement which all of us, and I mean all the members of the Governing Council, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> use so that we would indeed speak with one voice. </p>
<p>The developments at the last refinancing operation <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> induce us to do more intensive fine-tuning whenever that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be necessary again in the future. </p>
<p>For the time being, we have come to the conclusion that it is neither advisable with regard to the operational part of our work, nor for the monetary policy implications it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have, to change the schedule of our meetings at this time. </p>
<p>Because that <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> not only on the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> that it will be under 2% but also to what extent it will be under 2%. </p>
<p>If, as the President just said, conditions <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to warrant at a certain point in time special fine-tuning operations, we can always conduct them, but in most cases the framework we have is enough. </p>
<p>In other words, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say that we have kept interest rates on hold based on the considerations I have outlined to you. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say I hear but I do not listen. </p>
<p>I can not say that too often, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>So the choice of a <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender, at least the <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender as we perceive it, which has the very strong signalling effect of the minimum bid rate, does not help. </p>
<p>If at a certain point in time you have very strong expectations in the market and fixed interest rate tenders, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have the same kind of problems on the day of the auction. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you take that one Christian? </p>
<p>In addition, as I said, the second pillar signals that upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability have also diminished <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> over the past few months, but they have not disappeared. </p>
<p>And so you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also say that as far as monetary developments are concerned, with our policy of gradually increasing interest rates, which began in November 1999 and the last move of which was made in October 2000, we have achieved what we wanted to achieve, namely moderation in monetary growth and hence the disappearance of inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> over the medium term. </p>
<p>And as I said, the exchange rate itself is not a target for our monetary policy so if you want to know what the difference is, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I have very quickly explained that. </p>
<p>Today, as I indicated, the information from the first pillar indicates that upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability have diminished over the past few months. </p>
<p>Also, I will not evaluate what the impact is of statements that are <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuating</span> on either the euro or myself personally. </p>
<p>So the liquidity conditions and the financing conditions for private agents do not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be tight or to have any consequences for economic developments. </p>
<p>Of course the persistent - let me call it -" hesitating '' performance of the euro, which is keeping it more or less stable at a level which is lower than the level which we <span class='uncertainty'>assumed</span>, on which we based our forecasts, in itself increases the chances of it working its way through to inflation. </p>
<p>But fundamentally the answer to your implicit question as to how to deal with the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of underbidding lies with the whole framework that we have designed: we have this corridor with the deposit facility on one side and, in this case more importantly, the overdraft facility on the other side, so that there is no <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that the banking sector will be short of cash. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-05-10</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> a fact of everyday life in statistical series that there will be revisions and refinements from time to time. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> this is unavoidable. </p>
<p>So, not only speaking in mathematical terms, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that we have to - if you look at the curve - both bring down the line of the curve and reduce the angle. </p>
<p>But they do lead us to conclude that, whereas we thought earlier that we would already be under the 2% limit in August/September of this year, for example, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take us <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> repeat the answer I gave to the previous question that, psychologically, the most difficult thing is not to resist pressure, but to take action when action is needed on the basis of your own assessment of the situation and developments, despite any pressure in whatever direction. </p>
<p>Well, if we had waited... Let us <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> we had waited four weeks and we had moved then, and in the meantime we had made public the information as we are making it available today, and more extensively in the Monthly Bulletin of next week, then I am sure that in two weeks time your question would have been" what is new? </p>
<p>We will publish our second forecast, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, in the June Monthly Bulletin. </p>
<p>No, we are, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, as <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> about the precise future development of the US economy, which is of crucial importance to the world, as <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> the US authorities are themselves, and with that in mind, we have <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> our expectations downwards in line with all forecasts available on the outlook for growth for the euro area. </p>
<p>And as far as the Governing Council is concerned, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is true to say that they were not yet aware of that. </p>
<p>In mathematical terms it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that the first derivative of the distortion is positive. </p>
<p>This makes us <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> that, although before we thought we were approaching the reference value, now we know that, in fact, we have already been under the reference value of 4 1/2% for quite some time and increasingly so. </p>
<p>Well, I hope to have made it crystal clear in my introductory statement, and I repeat now for the second time: we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that with our move today we have reached a level of interest rates which is appropriate for the given situation. </p>
<p>And also because, as I said, it is not only the absolute magnitude, but also the change in size of this phenomenon - if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> call it that instead of a distortion - that has monetary policy implications. </p>
<p>So from both pillars we concluded that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to price stability had, if not disappeared totally, as the first pillar indicates, then at least, looking at the second pillar, diminished. </p>
<p>Under the first pillar, we have this new phenomenon of correcting the, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it again, dynamics of the M3 developments. </p>
<p>We are continuously in touch, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say. </p>
<p>And if you quote me about one week ago, I think you should quote me about two weeks ago - or at the last press conference we had - when we gave statement, or in the G7 context when we gave similar statements ; new facts lead to new assessments and they <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> lead to new conclusions, and that is what has happened. </p>
<p>The dynamics of M3 corrected <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be less that we thought earlier. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-06-07</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>Part of the explanation is, of course, the outflow of capital from Europe in the form of both direct investment and portfolio investment, in particular to the United States which, according to our judgement and analysis, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be inspired by exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> but <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> by a phenomenon of strategic importance. </p>
<p>So, there <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be, at least this year, an interruption - although we do hope that it is temporary - in the ongoing movement towards the ultimate goal to be achieved over the medium term. </p>
<p>And, knowing this, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that in my explanation today of the considerations and assessment in particular by the Governing Council of the medium-term economic outlook, in terms of both growth and prices, you will find a suitable justification and explanation for the interest rate move we applied a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>And, therefore, your question <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to run counter to that statement. </p>
<p>We have one monetary policy for the entire area and regional monetary policy does not exist, and we have a mandate as a monetary authority which is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> different from mandates that other big central banks have, namely to maintain price stability as the primary goal of the ECB. </p>
<p>And as such, I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - although I can not comment further on forecasts which still have to be released - I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they are already now too optimistic. </p>
<p>The phrase I used about the euro, that a strong euro is in the interest of the euro area, is indeed nothing new, but I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I can not repeat it often enough. </p>
<p>Oh yes, well, we have to say it <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span>. </p>
<p>So we do not expect and do not <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that the conversion itself will have a significant impact on inflation. </p>
<p>And I am not inclined to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on the impact. </p>
<p>And, in the third place, I have to say that <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> schedules do not fit quite well with each other. </p>
<p>Well, we are doing everything <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to counter it by continuing to explain our monetary policy actions over and over again, as I am doing today. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the fact that it led us to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that growth this year and next would come down <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> from the - I am inclined to call them -" exceptionally '' high levels recorded in the year 2000 to a level broadly consistent with the maximum range of the trend potential rate of growth, that is around 2.5%, represents a scaling-down of the growth forecast, which justifies my use of the words" limited impact ''. </p>
<p>I can not answer that question, but I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in" complots ''. </p>
<p>First, if we thought that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability today were lower than they were one month ago, I would not have said that we regard the monetary policy stance which we have as appropriate. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-06-21</b>, 11 sentences</p></div><p>But as for the time at which it will come down, that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be rather <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>I do hope that we will one day achieve the goal of having a single currency for as large an area as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, certainly encompassing all members of the European Union. </p>
<p>No, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not, Mr. Barber, because the German Government has now finalised its draft law on the Deutsche Bundesbank, on the structure of the Bundesbank itself, but has postponed for a few months bringing the draft law on banking supervision or" Allfinanz '' supervision to the Cabinet - and subsequently to the Parliament, after having received advice on that from the ECB. </p>
<p>The Nice Treaty included a so-called enabling clause saying that if the number of countries belonging to the European Union were to exceed a certain number, there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be an abbreviated procedure to change the decision-making process also at the ECB. </p>
<p>I already indicated earlier that I regard it as not unlikely that now, in May, we have reached the peak from which inflation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come down. </p>
<p>First of all, regarding the chances of recession, I said that we live in a global environment of very great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>It is true that for, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, 40% of the period for which we have been working, inflation has been in excess of that figure. </p>
<p>And we are already considering how that decision-making process <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> function if the decision-making bodies reach a rather unwieldy magnitude. </p>
<p>We feel no need to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> our own intentions or targets. </p>
<p>And those" base effects '' have been very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> in the course of 2000. </p>
<p>So we are not in a position to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> precisely when we will reach the magic 2%. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-07-05</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>And for that particular preparatory meeting, no central banker will be present or has been invited, and that also means that I have made no contacts of the kind that you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>. </p>
<p>I said the same thing as I said at this press conference, namely that our monetary policy stance <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> appropriate in the current circumstances. </p>
<p>We can not deny that it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have some impact on the exchange rate as well. </p>
<p>We are concerned that the current negative environment <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> reduce the impetus in various countries to reach the goals to which they have agreed in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> whether we would also see less <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> and guesswork in your circles. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> even see more of this were we to have fewer press conferences. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have struck you that I used the same language today as I used at the last press conference, namely that output growth is expected to be broadly in line with the trend potential growth. </p>
<p>The fact that in the Netherlands, and fortunately to a lesser extent in Ireland, inflation has reached the figures they have, is in itself a cause for concern, particularly for the Dutch and the Irish authorities ; and, to the extent that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have spillover effects on other countries, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be a concern for us and the Governing Council. </p>
<p>We are faced with the dilemma of, on the one hand, being as open and transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and on the other hand, with what we would see were we to have fewer press conferences. </p>
<p>The fact that there are inflation differentials between the various regions in the euro area is - as we have explained many times, and, I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say - normal. </p>
<p>Well I thought that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be clearer than that, but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I should repeat what I said two days ago. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> a surprise is unavoidable. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that in my statement of two days ago and in today 's statement, which is basically a statement by the Governing Council, I have been as open and transparent and forward-looking as I <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> can be. </p>
<p>And again, part of that small part <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> then be converted into other assets, which makes the conclusion justified that the monetary impact of these moves in the run-up to the cash changeover is very limited indeed, if not negligible. </p>
<p>So, if we were to change that in the direction in which you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>, we would in all <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> not reach that goal. </p>
<p>And all the factors that we have mentioned in the past explaining the depreciation of the euro now <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have reversed. </p>
<p>An additional factor is that we are seeing, in particular, a drastic decline in the circulation of large-denomination Deutsche Mark -LRB- and Guilder -RRB- banknotes coming <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> from the black economy. </p>
<p>I recognise that the selling of Deutsche Mark circulating in particular in central and eastern Europe and in Russia <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> partly have an impact on the exchange rate. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be months in which inflation stabilises or there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even be months in which it shows a further rise. </p>
<p>In our projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span>, so we do not <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> any change, strictly for - I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say -" scientific reasons ''. </p>
<p>But as I have said on various occasions, mainly because of the base effects of the development twelve months ago which, month after month, will fall out of the figures, the road to the level under 2% <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a bumpy one. </p>
<p>Well, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that you should address those questions to the American authorities. </p>
<p>I can not be clearer than that, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-08-30</b>, 10 sentences</p></div><p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the so-called core inflation rate will come down, but implied in your question is whether this will happen in the next few months: it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take a little bit longer. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we will have to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> that figure downwards. </p>
<p>But the strategy as such has not been changed, and we have -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say with some self-confidence -- been satisfied with the outcome of our communication over the past few months. </p>
<p>The information we have today, which we have only just received, supports what I just said about the fact that the slowdown in economic growth emanating from the slowdown in the United States is larger, deeper and more prolonged than had been <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> earlier. </p>
<p>And your imagination, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, is going too far. </p>
<p>I am very satisfied with the development of the euro, but I continue to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, in the future too, the euro has, given the performance of the European economy and of the US economy, strong potential to appreciate. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> you refer in your question to the exchange rate and not to the colour. </p>
<p>I can not forecast when another move will come, or in what direction it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>We obviously -- and, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, together with the US authorities -- <span class='uncertainty'>tended</span> to be too optimistic about the duration and the depth of the slowdown in the United States. </p>
<p>-- in June, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, and of course we update these continuously. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-10-11</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>Concerning the aid to national airlines, I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that you direct that question at the European Commission. </p>
<p>And events are still rapidly developing and we have to be very careful in using any room which there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>Now, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the fact that investors have temporarily shifted their portfolio investment into more liquid assets, which are part of M3, is a temporary phenomenon -- while your question implies that it will be a long-term phenomenon -- and that people would rather spend on consumer goods, I suppose, than start investing in portfolio assets anew. </p>
<p>So you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say that, in view of the very high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> confronting us, also in the immediate future, we prefer to" keep our powder dry ''. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that creating an environment of stable prices through a stability-oriented monetary policy in a forward-looking manner is the best contribution we can make not only to the growth of output and employment but also to the restoration of confidence within the public at large. </p>
<p>But in as far as budgetary positions develop, actually for purely cyclical reasons, to develop or to produce results which lead to deficits which are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> higher than is in conformity with the medium-term goals, that is acceptable. </p>
<p>Growth is slow, admittedly: slower than we had <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> earlier, but of a recession we do not speak. </p>
<p>To be seen to take effectively what was <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> an exceptional decision in exceptional circumstances, in bringing forward a rate cut that we had already contemplated before, applying it earlier than had been foreseen and making it larger -- within a matter of two hours, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say -- and also earlier than <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, this in response to the assessment that the horrible events in the United States <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have a negative impact on economic growth and thereby also cause the inflation rate to come down more strongly and sooner than earlier <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this is the most likely event and, therefore, we do not consider this course of the growth rate of M3 as a source of future inflationary pressures. </p>
<p>And they will lead us to <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the prospects for reaching price stability ; currently those prospects are fairly benign. </p>
<p>So, you can <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that the relative optimism was shared, but then one side remark: we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that growth, which has clearly slowed down in the course of this year and will continue to be very slow for the remainder of this year, will resume in the course of next year and <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> already in the early part of next year. </p>
<p>I did not say that, but I said that it is <span class='uncertainty'>doubtful</span> whether a range of rate changes coming quickly one after the other would by themselves enhance confidence rather than <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> even undermine confidence. </p>
<p>Do n't forget, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that everybody has forgotten that we lowered interest rates on 30 August 2001 and then again on 17 September 2001, and we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that with that level we have for the time being, barring new information on events yet to happen, new information to come in, that we have reached a level of interest rates which is consistent in the context of our monetary policy strategy with our declared aim of preserving price stability. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-11-08</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>As I explained today, we strongly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the strong M3 growth over the last few months has everything to do with factors which are really temporary. </p>
<p>If we get advice from all sides, especially political sides, to take certain measures, then one <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be tempted to become stubborn. </p>
<p>I still <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, and Mr. Eichel has confirmed this in public and in the Eurogroup meetings, that the governments are firmly committed, and remain committed, to reaching their goals as stated in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the stability programmes which they have presented, taking into account and to the extent that, for cyclical reasons, and because of the weak economic performance of the various economies in the Union, the actual nominal figures which are intended to be met are not being met. </p>
<p>Now, deflation does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be just around the corner, but HICP will be safely under the 2% limit we have set as the maximum which is compatible with price stability. </p>
<p>No, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a signal that markets have to listen more to me than to others. </p>
<p>We need two weeks per month for our work to be performed properly, but we thought that it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> inspire some calm in the markets if we made it known that a discussion in the media and the markets on the monetary policy stance will only take place once a month. </p>
<p>Because this development has become much clearer, unlike what you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate in your first question, precisely over the past few weeks as many new forecasts have become available from various international institutions and private forecasting groups and as new actual data have become available. </p>
<p>And on the second question: we have the impression that the bi-monthly meetings of the Governing Council also lead, every two weeks, to <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> in the markets and higher <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in exchange rates and market interest rates than would be the case if we had a calmer rhythm of meetings. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, today 's move fully reflects our assessment, over the medium term, of the inflationary tendencies, and it can be seen, as we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, that we have with this move reached a level of interest rates which is appropriate as a monetary policy stance in the light of that assessment. </p>
<p>If that high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> diminishes over time, which is what we expect, then we can also <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that M3 growth will come down to more natural figures. </p>
<p>Our assessment of the economic developments, especially after the events of 11 September, has led us to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that confidence has been hit harder than we thought only a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>You can <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> literally quote the Treaty in this respect, since today 's move <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be taken" without prejudice to price stability '', and it thereby supported the other goals of Economic and Monetary Union, such as economic growth. </p>
<p>Later than we previously <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>We still expect, as I said in my introduction, that inflation will fall to below 2% early next year, which is, in a way, earlier than we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>The other one is the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the economic prospects and the low level of confidence among consumers and investors. </p>
<p>One factor is the high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> prevailing all over the world on account of the events in Washington, New York and Afghanistan. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2001-12-06</b>, 9 sentences</p></div><p>And in the end we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is of the greatest importance to enhance confidence among both consumers and investors if governments stick to their medium-term strategy, whatever happens. </p>
<p>No, that would not be a reasonable <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>And that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be one of the causes -- the flexibility of the labour market is greater, mobility is greater -- that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be one of the causes for the euro, let me call it," failing '' to catch up with the dollar so far. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>differs</span> per country. </p>
<p>This year, however, <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> highly unlikely to me. </p>
<p>We are aware that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> -- by chance or accident -- be a few vending machines that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been equipped to accept euro coins a little earlier than 1 January. </p>
<p>I can be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more precise: I would expect the upturn in the course of the first half of next year. </p>
<p>I see no danger of deflation and, contrary to what you are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span>, inflation is not falling faster than we expect it to. </p>
<p>We have taken note of the forecasts that are being prepared by the staff of the Eurosystem, i.e. the NCBs and the ECB, and those forecasts will be made public in our forthcoming Monthly Bulletin -- I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, on 14 December -- so that I can not comment now on precisely what the forecast would entail for next year. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-01-03</b>, 12 sentences</p></div><p>That moment was preceded by an upward move of the exchange rate which <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> was <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> overstating and it has proven to be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> overstating the" europhoria '' that governed at that time. </p>
<p>But I can just confirm that this move that we expect is not an objective per se, but that what we expect to happen will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> take place in all fields. </p>
<p>But I do n't want to ask Mr. Noyer to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about the" when '', precisely if I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> he knows as much as I do. </p>
<p>And it was expected to be very slow, but increasingly we are getting signals that countries, especially central banks of countries, are beginning to realise the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> they now have to diversify their reserve holdings. </p>
<p>I would like to say: pretty confident, but there is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and that is that we are quite <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> about the external developments, in particular in the United States. </p>
<p>There is simply <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> around and that does put a downward <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> on my confidence. </p>
<p>No, I do not want to point to individual trade unions, however large they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>But we are still very <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> about the precise timing and we also think that it will be a very gradual process, as I said in my introduction. </p>
<p>I am personally sure that it will develop, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> slowly, we will see. </p>
<p>I am here to fight <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> rather than to add to it. </p>
<p>I will not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> further. </p>
<p>Contrary to what you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate, we expect the first quarter of this year, in which we now are, to be pretty much the same as the last two quarters of last year. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-02-07</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>And I do not know what will happen in the forthcoming days, I am not talking in terms of a compromise, but if there are ways to extract certain definitive and well-defined commitments from the governments concerned, that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> replace the early warning. </p>
<p>First of all, I went public in the interests of transparency and, admittedly, I was <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> worried about the intensifying wave of <span class='uncertainty'>speculative</span> statements and articles in the markets and the media about the date of my departure, and also about a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> link -- which there is not -- between my departure and the appointment of the successor to my right-hand neighbour, Mr. Noyer, which has to be dealt with shortly. </p>
<p>Is it imaginable that all those members, who have a fixed term of appointment, not renewable, would <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span> become lame ducks in their last year? </p>
<p>The letter to Secretary General Solana which was written in December last year was a purely administrative and, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, usual affair. </p>
<p>I personally happen to think that in Europe we will see more definite signs already in the first half of this year, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> towards the end of the first half of this year, but in any other respect, we have not changed our assessment for a gradual recovery which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> take -- and now I am talking for Europe only -- the growth rate in the last part of this year up to the potential growth rate at an annualised rate. </p>
<p>For that reason, Sveriges Riksbank has to have adequate capital and reserves to absorb all shocks that any central bank <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> face. </p>
<p>Legally speaking, if he wanted to he <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> continue of course. </p>
<p>Regarding my plans for after 9 July 2003, except in the case that the Council were to ask me to stay on a little bit longer: I have no plans whatsoever, except to enjoy life a little bit more intensively than was <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> up until now, with my wife and in the midst of my family, <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> partly away from the Netherlands, in France. </p>
<p>As for the second question, how <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> governments react to that, well, I would say:" Thank you very much and we will do our utmost ''. </p>
<p>We live in a world of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and by taking away one of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, which I have now done, I think I have made a contribution to a climate of greater quietness concerning these two important institutions, the ECB and the euro. </p>
<p>So nobody can <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that any longer. </p>
<p>But at least one <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> has been removed and that is about the date of my departure. </p>
<p>Of course, there will be <span class='uncertainty'>speculations</span> in the future about who my successor will be and when my succession will be arranged. </p>
<p>I judged -- and my colleagues concurred -- that this wave of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> surrounding the ECB and the euro was detrimental to the image and the credibility of the ECB and the euro. </p>
<p>In my letter to Prime Minister Aznar of Spain, I stated that I wanted to resign on 9 July 2003 but that I would be willing to stay on <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer if that, in the judgement of the Heads of State and Government, were in the interests of a smooth transition of the Presidency of the European Central Bank. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-03-07</b>, 12 sentences</p></div><p>-LRB- Laughing -RRB- I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have helped you slightly on the first question. </p>
<p>Well, it is not exactly within the competencies of the European Central Bank, but I fully sympathise with all the efforts being made at the moment in the context of the World Trade Organisation to try to prevent, to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, the world from slipping back into an era of protectionism. </p>
<p>What the EU Council has done in the Nice Agreement is to include an enabling clause which makes it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, after the Nice Treaty has been ratified, to make quick changes if necessary. </p>
<p>We are working hard on it, we are investigating various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> and we will finalise those investigations, I expect, in the course of this year -- so well before the final ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the 15 Member States. </p>
<p>According to the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> expertise, but all this is of course disputable, filtering out the portfolio shifts <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> bring back notionally the increase towards 5%, close to 5% instead of 8%. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span> most of the explanation is linked to that. </p>
<p>But what you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> expect at one time or another to have to attend an euro group meeting or whatever it is alone and be accepted there by the participants. </p>
<p>I am rather inclined to turn the thing around and conclude that <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> this -- what I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say -- deplorable action by the United States ' authorities to protect its steel industry <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have something to do with the exchange rate of the dollar as it is being experienced by the American steel industry. </p>
<p>But I do admit that, inevitably, it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be a typically European phenomenon that these appointments are discussed across the regions of Europe given that we have different nationalities, cultures and languages. </p>
<p>So if you qualify that as reasonably optimistic, I would <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to agree with you. </p>
<p>We have started working on that in case we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> consider it necessary -- of which we are not yet sure. </p>
<p>And, also, if you look at the annualised development of the last three months, you come to the same kind of conclusion -- that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be progressively -- not completely returning to normal but going in the direction of more normal developments in the very last period. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-04-04</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>And to buy equities is, let me put it this way, for many central banks not <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>. </p>
<p>It is appropriate and I do not want to engage in any <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about future moves. </p>
<p>As far as the statement by President Welteke is concerned, I would like to remind you that he has declared that the Bundesbank <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> sell some of its gold stocks over the medium to long term. </p>
<p>The succession of Ms Hämäläinen and -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I add -- of myself is not yet on the agenda. </p>
<p>If the recent rise in oil prices, which has been significant, persists or even continues to rise, there will obviously be <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to both inflation and output developments. </p>
<p>And the measures on the labour market that are being contemplated in various countries <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> very much from country to country, but I do think it is very much of interest to restructure the functioning of the labour markets, in particular in the countries you have mentioned. </p>
<p>I expect a proposal <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> in Oviedo or shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>I agree with the statement that if there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> they are mainly on the upside. </p>
<p>To what extent and how quickly they would emerge or materialise is totally <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>How do I assess the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability? </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> cause some -- let me call it --" bias '' in the judgement of the people, and I do hope that that effect will fade away sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>And as far as the succession of my distinguished colleague here is concerned, I refrain, also there, from <span class='uncertainty'>speculating</span>. </p>
<p>I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> again about the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that inflation on average <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> turn out higher than 2%. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-05-02</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> when I stated in my introductory remarks that the outcome of ongoing wage negations in some regions of the euro area <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become a matter of concern, I think those who can hear can also listen. </p>
<p>We briefly discussed it in the knowledge that the ECOFIN Council will next week <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> go in the direction of taking a decision on the future co-operation of supervisory and central bank authorities. </p>
<p>All the remarks I made do indicate that there is a great deal of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, that we have had some, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call them," disappointing '' developments in the area of oil prices, and of services prices in general, and therefore that, added to the wage developments that are going on here and there, I would be inclined to say that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are indeed now more on the upside than on the downside. </p>
<p>We do regard the current monetary policy stance as being appropriate, but we also admit that the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> surrounding our assessment is greater than ever. </p>
<p>We have had some disappointments, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, but one factor that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help to attain this goal, of course, once it works its way through, is the effect of the recent strengthening of the euro, provided that it continues. </p>
<p>Our mandate compels us to include in the discussion of the ministers the relevant provision in the Treaty, and we try to do that by incorporating our Banking Supervision Committee in the structure that will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> emerge. </p>
<p>What I am concerned about is the tendencies that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> emerge, and indeed <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> already have emerged, towards increased protectionism, as has happened in the United States in the steel sector. </p>
<p>Are the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability now on the upside rather than on the downside? </p>
<p>I am not, however, going to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about what would happen should this situation develop further. </p>
<p>The recent sharp increase in oil prices and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> greater impact of the cash changeover on the rounding of prices has made us <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> the outlook for prices. </p>
<p>The main <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> I have in mind is the huge and growing current account deficit of over 4% of GDP in the United States which, I am inclined to say, is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to the world economy. </p>
<p>I still <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we will reach the potential growth rate of the euro area -- which we estimate to be between 2 and 2.5% -- towards the end of this year and that next year we will even surpass it. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I can say this on behalf of the press as well. </p>
<p>Only the timing <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be foreseen but came at a very unfortunate moment. </p>
<p>And I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it will have, as far as it has gone now, any impact on the real economy developments, on output and export capabilities. </p>
<p>I would not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on a more rapid development of whichever exchange rate, as you can understand. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-06-06</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>In no way do we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that at the present time the exchange rate is any impediment to the further growth and recovery of our exports. </p>
<p>So, it is not by chance that the word" appropriate '' no longer <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> in my statement. </p>
<p>Well, to take the last question first, I did point to some increased <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>For that, another number of years will be required in order to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in full and it remains to be seen how quickly, and that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from country to country, every individual country is in a position to comply with the criteria. </p>
<p>There have been other shocks, too: I 'm thinking of September 11, I 'm thinking of the foot-and-mouth disease and other veterinary illnesses which have had an <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> but upward impact on inflation and which help to explain this. </p>
<p>Well they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come back again, and they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even increase and then we would react. </p>
<p>Well, whether it is <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>, it is an ambitious target, if you want to call it a target. </p>
<p>But as to when is completely <span class='uncertainty'>undetermined</span>. </p>
<p>It is true that this <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> will be the third year where we will miss or at least only come close to our stated objective. </p>
<p>There are many <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, but the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have moved, let me say, in an upward direction. </p>
<p>Of course, improvements <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> always be <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Now, the developments in January, the weather conditions and the oil price hikes in January and February have crossed this expectation to the extent that the medium-term perspective is that inflation will later than earlier <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> fall to below 2% or stay at 2%. </p>
<p>I do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the prompt and adequate reaction of the ECB to underlying developments in the outlook for price stability in the form of a range of interest rate changes has been adequate, and that the fact that we are close to but not at, admittedly, an inflation rate in line with the maximum of our stated objectives can not but enhance the credibility of the ECB. </p>
<p>Now, we will publish -- as we do twice a year -- our new forecast in, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, seven days time, in the forthcoming issue of the Monthly Bulletin, and this still has to be finalised. </p>
<p>I would <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to agree with that. </p>
<p>I can not answer the last question because I do not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what the" appropriate level '' is for the euro in a world that is ever-changing. </p>
<p>I fully understand their fear that an ever-stronger yen <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> jeopardise the early signs of recovery which are emerging in Japan. </p>
<p>I 'll not comment on the" here '' or the" there '', but they <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be adding to the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And I have reason to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say from the highest sources, that there can be no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that France, as a full member of the euro area and the European Union, will live up to its commitments which it took upon itself when establishing the Stability and Growth Pact at the Summit in Dublin. </p>
<p>Mr. Eichel has <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> said that a higher exchange rate and lower interest rates were more favourable that the other way round. </p>
<p>In the past three years we have had an <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> accumulation and coincidence of negative shocks. </p>
<p>If there is a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> collapse in any financial market that would be <span class='uncertainty'>speculating</span> to an irresponsible extent. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-07-04</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>Well, you will have noticed that in my Introductory Statement I did not use the concept of" hovering '', but of" <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuating</span> ''. </p>
<p>As far as the balance between upside and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is concerned, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are still <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> on the upside, but the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> are too great to come to decisions already at this stage. </p>
<p>As I said, we are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> concerned about -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it -- the" slippage '' in interpretation which has emerged from Seville. </p>
<p>What I do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> are the most recent statements to this effect by Eurostat and the revisions they made to the Italian public accounts. </p>
<p>But at the same time, given that the recovery of domestic demand is also relatively weak, this explains our <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, not about the size of the recovery, but about the strength of the recovery. </p>
<p>But, as I said in my answer to Mr. Thomas, the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in this world of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is still slightly on the upside. </p>
<p>We do not and we did not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>, theorise or analyse about the size of any change that was not contemplated. </p>
<p>We do not expect <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> and quick results, but it is pretty certain that the results will come. </p>
<p>You are pointing to facts that are <span class='uncertainty'>unknown</span> to me. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, I would. </p>
<p>In the United States, it would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be more of a problem for consumers. </p>
<p>For the remainder of this year, we expect the inflation rate to <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuate</span>, or hover, or whatever you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to call it, around 2%. </p>
<p>As to the credibility of our attitude of, basically, waiting and seeing in these <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> circumstances, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have adequately explained why we have taken the attitude we cherish at the moment. </p>
<p>... <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I answer this question first? </p>
<p>Now, at the end of your question there was a concern as to how these developments - that is the increase in demand by non-residents - <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> affect monetary developments in the euro area. </p>
<p>So, we do see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> you have pointed out, but we are taking the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> deliberately. </p>
<p>The other countries have taken note of this declaration that made the achievement of this goal more or less <span class='uncertainty'>contingent</span> on the attainment of a growth rate of 3% in 2003 and 2004 of 3%, which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be considered to be -- to say it prudently -- on the upside of the potential growth rate of the country. </p>
<p>We are in the happy position where the Eurosystem as such holds so much foreign currency reserves that it will at all times be equipped to meet any disaster which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> loom on the horizon. </p>
<p>The two developments together <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there must have been some offsetting in other types of liabilities of MFIs. </p>
<p>And the holdings place no constraint on whatever action we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> want to take. </p>
<p>We have carefully considered and discussed the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> you draw attention to. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-09-12</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>And I will not join you in making estimates of what the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the exchange rate are. </p>
<p>I can not quantify that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> over a period of time. </p>
<p>How great the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are to that assessment? </p>
<p>Well, if there is a jump in oil prices, as there has been already, in the first instance it is a danger, an upward <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>There is a general resentment amongst the public, and it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be growing here and there, against the perceived inflation, which is clearly higher in the eyes of the public than the measured inflation, which encompasses a much larger basket of goods, when you measure it over time. </p>
<p>I would not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on future developments which I hope will not take place. </p>
<p>It is not against the euro -- the euro is <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> the scapegoat for all that -- but it is against the restaurateurs, against the hotel sector, hairdressers and so on, who <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> in the beginning have abused the transition to the euro by rounding, in a <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> dramatic way, upward. </p>
<p>Well, again, I will not enter into that debate, knowing that the debate is raging throughout the United Kingdom and the best thing I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do to prevent Britain from joining is to speak out about it. </p>
<p>But then it is <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> good to know that the Lamfalussy proposals were made explicitly for the securities industry. </p>
<p>I will not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on that. </p>
<p>We live in a time of extreme <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> at the moment, and I really can not quantify it. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say that I am equally worried about the inflation prospects as I am about the output prospects. </p>
<p>Now, there have been, of course, some concerns regarding the perceived impact of the changeover on price changes and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you are referring to this. </p>
<p>All that has been asked of us is to come up with a proposal, if necessary -- that has also to be judged -- to come up with a proposal as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. </p>
<p>And I prefer, also in this respect, not to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about any likely consequence or any likely reaction to what we know or what we do n't know is going to happen. </p>
<p>But it is one of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> you and we are being faced with. </p>
<p>But what, of course, we know from the statistics is that -- although it is correct that the prices of some services and some goods have risen <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> this has been influenced by the changeover -- the weighted average of the prices of all goods, as recorded by the consumer price index, has been influenced to a very small extent. </p>
<p>What precise impact an eventual military adventure <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on the monetary policy of the ECB or on inflationary developments <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>, of course, very much on the nature and the size of the activities to be deployed, and the effects -- in particular -- on the oil market and on the remainder or the rest of the region in the Middle East, and is therefore, at this stage, totally <span class='uncertainty'>unpredictable</span>. </p>
<p>I would not join in the <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about what will happen to the German budget in the course of this year. </p>
<p>I am very pleased that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be balanced at the moment. </p>
<p>On the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a war or military operation in Iraq: of course, this adds greatly to the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> we are confronted with and to which I referred earlier. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-10-10</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>We do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this by any means. </p>
<p>That is confidence-inspiring, especially also in times when the economy or economic developments are weak or weaker than <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>And that includes the statements made by the ministers -- I should say by all but one minister -- and the ECB that the adjustment has to start as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, that is, in 2003, to be precise. </p>
<p>There it said:" Our conclusion is that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are at present balanced. </p>
<p>You have to distinguish between the structural deficit and the structural measures underlying the budget position and the cyclically caused <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the desired path. </p>
<p>Our position is that not only the ECB but also national central banks should be involved in all layers of the structure to the maximum extent <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> or feasible. </p>
<p>The latest indications are that even in Germany the inflation rate is not falling further ; it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even be creeping up <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> but it remains very, very low indeed. </p>
<p>But we also see no signs in these countries that this development <span class='uncertainty'>might</span>" degenerate '', so to say, in the direction of deflation. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our strategy and on our mandate, on what monetary policy can do. </p>
<p>Now, if outsiders, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> also central bankers, say we have to act more quickly and swiftly and be more determined to cut rates in the current situation, then I would like to point out that we base our monetary policy decisions on a thorough analysis of both monetary developments and a wide range of indicators related to the real and the nominal economy. </p>
<p>There are upside and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to our primary objective. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the authorities, both the monetary and fiscal authorities, can contribute towards eliminating the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and boosting confidence by following a steady line by inspiring confidence through their steady, determined following of the policies, as they should do. </p>
<p>Yes, I say" yes '' again... and they should start as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And then <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> I can briefly answer your question that, contrary to what you <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, the word" appropriate '' was not used in my introductory statement today. </p>
<p>The main problem plaguing our economies both here and across the Atlantic is the combination of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> prevailing and confidence lacking. </p>
<p>First of all, on the -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it --" robustness '' of financial institutions, generally speaking in Europe they are robust. </p>
<p>Well, I pointed out in my introductory statement that there are still <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> but the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are balanced. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-11-07</b>, 20 sentences</p></div><p>But then let me say that the utterances and the discussions about the Stability and Growth Pact are very much a thing, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, of the past --, of the very recent past. </p>
<p>We have surveys, but they <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> give, admittedly, conflicting signals. </p>
<p>But of course we are taking into account the fact -- and are disappointed by the fact -- that it will come later than we originally <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>We hope to be able to come up with a proposal shortly, as the Heads of State have asked us to do as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> after the ratification of the Nice Treaty. </p>
<p>On the particular aspect of taking monetary policy decisions by a -- let me call it -- simple majority, which, in the future, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give rise to a situation where the monetary policy decision is taken by a group in the Governing Council, which, by the way, includes the Executive Board, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be regarded as not representing the major part or the most important part of the European Union or the euro area. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is enough what I have said, that, after an extensive discussion, the view prevailed that we would be well advised to leave interest rates unchanged today. </p>
<p>Partly, because there is a notable preference for holding liquid assets and for portfolio shifts occurring in the light of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> in the financial markets. </p>
<p>Well, we do not stick to rules like the" Taylor rule '', so I prefer not to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>So, the climate is one of high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and there, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, the assessment made by the FOMC is very similar to the assessment made by the Governing Council. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the circumstances in the future, but it is true that you have never heard me say that before. </p>
<p>And so, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> your question should be raised in other circles. </p>
<p>But the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> quoted by the Fed in its Communiqué is the same as the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> we feel. </p>
<p>It has very much to do, as I said, with the geopolitical situation and the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> surrounding future developments of oil prices. </p>
<p>The fact that the Fed changed rates yesterday was not much of a surprise, though I was <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> surprised by the magnitude. </p>
<p>Well, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be for the next round. </p>
<p>First of all, I have not seen that letter, so I can not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what I would answer had I seen it. </p>
<p>I already mentioned" one man, one vote '', I mentioned the degree of representativeness, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also mention the fact that the proposal has to be transparent, to be easily understood. </p>
<p>Given all these <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> complex principles which we take as the starting-point, it is very difficult to fulfil the requirements of another principle, that is transparency. </p>
<p>It says nothing about the size nor the moment of a rate cut, I say again, <span class='uncertainty'>sometime</span> in the future. </p>
<p>And we also want continuity, we now have a track record of decision-making of <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> five years, and it has, in our feeling been a success, that process of decision-making and we want continuity of that process. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2002-12-05</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>When the Governing Council decides that the rates will be such and such, they are -- <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> by definition -- appropriate. </p>
<p>I am sorry to be so long, I wish I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> tell you more, but to translate all this into a perfect legal text which stands, we need some time. </p>
<p>On your first question, I should have <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> added in the first place that our agreement also includes that the voting members should be the members of the Executive Board, of which there are 6, plus 15. </p>
<p>And the voting rights assigned to each group would <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore, where competition is less, prices <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> rise more. </p>
<p>And then there was one other principle to which we also paid due respect, that is: if you have a Governing Council which comprises countries of very different size and you limit the voting frequency of individual members over time, then you would run the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that decisions <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be taken by a number of Governing Council members that would be, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it, unrepresentative for the euro area as a whole if you measure it by GDP or by population or however. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> Market News International <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> repeat its question. </p>
<p>But it is also explicable: part of the core inflation that remains stubbornly high is, in particular, the persistent rise in prices of services and that, in turn, is in part <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the fact that in Europe we have an internal market. </p>
<p>And in trade in services, in contrast to trade in goods, competition across borders is governed less by official rules than by culture and <span class='uncertainty'>unwritten</span> rules, and is thus more limited. </p>
<p>Yes, but I would n't <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on any kind of shocks. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> we are. </p>
<p>So, all those things have changed and also, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say honestly, if we had moved one month ago you would have been very surprised. </p>
<p>There has been confirmation of our view, and <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> even for a few more months, that inflation will be -- albeit temporarily -- persistently over the 2% limit, but that it will come down. </p>
<p>Well, we hate using fixed formulas for certain situations, and despite the remarkable interpretation efforts by your colleague, Mr. Burckhardt, of every word and sentence that we say, well, as I said, we hate using fixed formulas, but we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have used the word" appropriate ''. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> not, and <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> foreign central banks even make it public themselves. </p>
<p>Since 7 November there has not been any abatement of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> I would say, rather on the contrary, more <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> than ever. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Somewhat</span> disappointed? </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-01-09</b>, 10 sentences</p></div><p>With regard to the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance, we were not so sure in December whether we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> use the word. </p>
<p>But that is indeed a very slow process that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take decades. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the downside have increased <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, due mainly to, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I call it, the lack of the disappearance of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that is prevailing. </p>
<p>But the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is still prevailing and it permeates and pervades the minds of consumers and investors alike. </p>
<p>I will not enter into any <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about who will be my successor, as you can understand and as you undoubtedly <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>Apart from that, the exchange rate remains one of our important indicators which we take into account in assessing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability when taking the overall decision, as we did today, to establish the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the recent further appreciation of the euro, as I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> Mr. Welteke has also said yesterday or today, has no negative impact on the competitive position of Europe vis-à-vis the rest of the world. </p>
<p>We do see both upward and downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation, and the lack of certainty, the lack of confidence and the slow movement of economic activity are helping to keep inflation down. </p>
<p>Now, if, in the future, the underlying <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> were disqualified, in other words growth were less than currently officially <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> -- that is less than 1ï ¿ 1/2% -- what attitude the Commission would then take remains to be seen. </p>
<p>We had hoped that this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> would gradually disappear and that is the main cause for concern. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-02-06</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>I would not go as far as your suggestion <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> imply, that that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> would have to be out of the way before we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do anything. </p>
<p>But that is the largest amount of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> we have seen in many weeks and therefore, neither the speed and certainly not the degree of so-called" <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> '' -- which was not much -- is a cause of concern for us. </p>
<p>Well, I do not like to answer <span class='uncertainty'>speculative</span> or hypothetical questions. </p>
<p>On the first part we have, internally in the ECB, viewed various scenarios where you have to make <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>: if there is a war, how long will it last? </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> relating to oil prices, the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and, well, let me say this: we were afraid that if one were to cut, at this moment, it would be a drop that would drown in the sea of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<p>Well, as I have learned -- as have you, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> -- on foreign exchange interventions I will keep my mouth shut, so I will say nothing about it. </p>
<p>What is a curious thing, let me put it that way, is that -- when in the past there was geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> as we now euphemistically call it -- the dollar was the" safe haven '' for the world. </p>
<p>On the first, the geopolitical situation is one of the factors of grave and great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the world. </p>
<p>And I will not be surprised if they have to be slightly <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downwards. </p>
<p>But I would emphasise that the behaviour of the exchange rate over recent months has not been all that <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>And we prefer stability to <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Volatility</span> is always bad. </p>
<p>But you can read from my Introductory Statement that whereas, on the one hand, I repeated what I said last month that the monetary policy stance is appropriate, I also added the words" that for the time being '' we still <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that the high degree of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> will decline in the course of this year. </p>
<p>But that was not even ripe enough, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, to present to the Governing Council, let alone to you. </p>
<p>We have had enough studies, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>The impediments to cutting rates at this moment are the big <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> that still surround the figures that you mentioned. </p>
<p>From that, you can infer some increased <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> also on our side. </p>
<p>But if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> make one comment, I would like to emphasise that our main interest rates are currently at 2ï ¿ 1/2%. </p>
<p>In that case, there was a legitimate fear on behalf of especially the larger countries, that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> easily -- also on monetary policy -- be outvoted by a majority representing -- in aggregate terms -- less than 3-4% of the enlarged euro area GDP. </p>
<p>Now, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do that. </p>
<p>Turning to the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we already took these into account in our decision to lower interest rates by 50 basis points in December. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the downside have increased. </p>
<p>So they are still there but they were not <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<p>Those downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have certainly not disappeared since then. </p>
<p>To the critics of the rotation model that we unanimously agreed on in the Governing Council and that we have presented to the European Council in the composition of heads of state and government, well I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say I still have to meet someone, including myself, who is unconditionally happy with the outcome. </p>
<p>As for the projections, I can not say at the moment: the issue is in full swing at staff level and, of course, the underlying <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> have to be changed. </p>
<p>First of all, the euro has for some weeks now been <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuating</span> around a level against the dollar of around 1.08, which is still slightly below the average level of the euro in the two years preceding the introduction of the euro. </p>
<p>Well, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you have already given the answer yourself. </p>
<p>I wish as little <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And if you now expand the Governing Council by at least ten members, and in the Nice Treaty it is counted on that there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be 12 extra members, which would then be 27, plus six of the Executive Board, which makes 33. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> I should add two points. </p>
<p>We publicly said that this step in December was <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> larger than one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have otherwise <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, because of the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we saw emerging then. </p>
<p>As far as the timetable is concerned, I read <span class='uncertainty'>somewhere</span> that it will be decided whilst I was still President and it would be published on the first day of the new President 's term of office. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-03-06</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>By now the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> are so great and the developments <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come so fast. </p>
<p>But as I said, both the growth figures and the inflation figures had, sorry to say it, to be <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downward and not insignificantly. </p>
<p>I do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the exchange rate development brings the mutual relationship more in line with the fundamentals as they develop and have developed over time between these two great economic areas. </p>
<p>The forecasts we have available now do not, basically, <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from those which were published by the IMF. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also say, ceterum censeo, carthaginem delendam esse. </p>
<p>So any conclusion you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> want to draw already today is certainly premature. </p>
<p>And we are doing that in a, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, calm and unprejudiced manner. </p>
<p>That I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span>. </p>
<p>We had new forecasts, we have them four times a year, and actually I had them the evening before I attended the G7 meeting -- at which you were present, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, and heard me make my statement. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the markets did not expect us to wait. </p>
<p>On the contrary, in our expectations, there is little <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> that it will come down in the course of this year, and for next year, we are also very <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> about it. </p>
<p>The reason" why '' is that we thought that this cut by 25 basis points was, in the current <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> circumstances we live in, the most appropriate. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> complicate <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> the decisions in the Council on which wine to choose for the lunch. </p>
<p>And the implication that I think was derived from this reference to the smile is that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> exist some tensions between Mr. Issing and myself. </p>
<p>Especially the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> are such and so large that it is simply impossible to make a precise judgement about what monetary policy would do and will do. </p>
<p>So, the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in our assessment has <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> diminished but at the same time we thought that one drop would be better than two drops. </p>
<p>Four weeks ago I said that a drop then would be a drop in a sea of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and go by unnoticed. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Occasionally</span>, we do disagree: I think that <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> he <span class='uncertainty'>tends</span> to prefer Bordeaux and I prefer Burgundy. </p>
<p>And then I -- and I should say we -- can not and did not want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on how the events will evolve once a war breaks out. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-04-03</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>So it would be pure <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> to go into further detail about the various scenarios which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> develop, without knowing which one has the greatest <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of being realised. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to remind you that when you hear outsiders talk about this, they also talk about it in the light of the upcoming G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, which is to take place on Saturday next week. </p>
<p>I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say: we continuously ask ourselves the same question. </p>
<p>Question -LRB- Translation -RRB-: Mr. President, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> explain something. </p>
<p>You refer to modest and moderate growth in the second half of the year, but <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you give us a figure? </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> suffice to literally repeat what I said in my introductory statement on behalf of the Governing Council, and I quote:" Our baseline scenario continues to be one of a moderate recovery associated with diminishing <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, starting in the second half of 2003 ''. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> that will be final, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> we will need another discussion two weeks later -- we are rather flexible on that -- but I can assure you that I will be in a position to answer all your questions, <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> before the end of May. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> add that the word" recession '' has not been used in today 's Governing Council discussion. </p>
<p>What <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> surprises us is the higher degree of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that we observe in the markets, both in the foreign exchange markets and in the markets for financial assets. </p>
<p>The current times are characterised by a high degree of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>A smooth transition can take anything from one week to one month, to two months, to three months -- it is completely <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make both their and our lives more difficult in the future. </p>
<p>By setting a firm framework for the future monetary policy stance, we hope to contribute to diminishing this <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> to the best of our abilities. </p>
<p>-LRB- Translation -RRB- In a highly <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> environment, due to geopolitical tensions -- and this is an understatement -- we must rebuild confidence. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Uncertainty</span> leads to cutting expenditure for investment and consumption. </p>
<p>You asked: what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> a rate cut do in the current circumstances? </p>
<p>At times of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> we must ensure that we stay on the right track. </p>
<p>I am very pleased to hear the sounds from the other side of the ocean, that the prospects there <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be bright. </p>
<p>As far as the second part of your question is concerned, as I indicated in my introduction already: <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about future developments is so large that we have various scenarios about what will happen once the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> diminishes. </p>
<p>I can not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what will happen after the war, if and when the war is over. </p>
<p>A change in the monetary policy stance is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> at any moment when our analysis -- which is based on a well-defined monetary policy strategy, as you all know -- leads us to decide on such a change - war or no war. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the exchange rate has <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> been a little bit more intensive than in the days before the war. </p>
<p>And that has nothing to do with <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>I would just like to repeat one passage from the introductory statement:" In a highly <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> environment, it is all the more essential that governments help to boost investor and consumer confidence by taking decisive action to implement structural reforms. '' </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-05-08</b>, 35 sentences</p></div><p>A yearly review in this context has <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> led to some <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>We always consider <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but there is no <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of inaction. </p>
<p>We have, of course, considered <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>The twin deficit has emerged, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say, and we do hope that the inevitable adjustment which has to take place, and which will take place over time, will occur in an orderly and gradual manner. </p>
<p>But this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not happen. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I refer the remainder of your questions to the second part of this press conference. </p>
<p>That can be phrased, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, much more elegantly and concisely, whereas our main concern -- that of the entire Governing Council -- is that the Convention 's proposal should in no way change anything in the mandate, in the independence, in the legal position, in the power to issue regulations of the Eurosystem, the ECB, and the ESCB. </p>
<p>Finally," close to 2% '' clarifies what we have done so far, what we have had in mind so far and what we will try to continue to achieve, and if the next four-and-a-half years are marked, as were the past four-and-a-half years, by inflation expectations of below 2%, in a range of 1.7% to 1.9%, I think that this would be a result that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> nobody would have expected before the euro was introduced. </p>
<p>With our <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> now, that we aim to keep inflation at close to 2%, I think it is clear enough that we are not blind in the eye which identifies deflationary problems. </p>
<p>And second, this" close to 2% '' is not a change, it is a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> of what we have done so far, what we have achieved -- namely inflation expectations remaining in a narrow range of between <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> 1.7% and 1.9% -- and what we intend to do in our forward-looking monetary policy. </p>
<p>But then, as Mr. Greenspan used to say, it is very difficult to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> a bubble. </p>
<p>What we do in the changed format of the introductory statement, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> again see this as I think it reads much better now, is that we start with more short-term developments in the economic analysis part and then move finally to monetary analysis with a focus on medium to long-term elements, before organising the cross-checking. </p>
<p>Well, that <span class='uncertainty'>varies</span> from participant to participant in the discussion. </p>
<p>This still gives money a very prominent role in the assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> critics argue that we should combine both assessments into one single assessment or one pillar, or whatever you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> want to call it. </p>
<p>I think that what has certainly not changed, and what was always in our minds, is that if we were to identify a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of inflation approaching very low levels on a sustainable basis and threatening to fall below 1% in a persistent way, then we should of course be extremely concerned. </p>
<p>The speed at which it is strengthening is <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> equal to the speed at which it declined two years ago. </p>
<p>All the reasons indicated, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say, to still wait a while. </p>
<p>We are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> exhausted and need some recreation now. </p>
<p>That does not mean that there were no <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views. </p>
<p>So, what information we get we get in an informal way and <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> we respond in an informal way. </p>
<p>In the past there has been some <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and some criticism about the exact aim of monetary policy within the quantitative definition of price stability adopted. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on developments in financial markets, etc.. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this underestimation of growth prospects is -- I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say -- a worldwide phenomenon. </p>
<p>Ex post, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that the policies pursued over the last four years have shown that this was indeed the strategy pursued. </p>
<p>This does not mean that you start from a point of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>: you simply want to be more certain that you are on the right track and this, of course, can only be done at large intervals. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> we have previously not communicated it successfully enough. </p>
<p>Today 's <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> helps to this end. </p>
<p>One can say that the euro -- at the moment -- is about at the level which, as we also said in Greece, better reflects the fundamentals and it is <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> at average historical levels. </p>
<p>What we have discovered is that this annual review <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> causes misunderstanding and <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>So I do not expect -- and there is no reason to expect -- a different monetary policy on the basis of the <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> of the strategy, which was decided on today. </p>
<p>Changes in the trend velocity of money and in potential growth are <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on factors which are not, so to speak, connected to the calendar year. </p>
<p>If you are married and after four years of a happy married life, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> one evening you sit together over a glass of wine and think about why you are so happy all the time: nobody would say it does not make sense. </p>
<p>But as the President has already said, even if we had had the same <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> back in 1998, our policy would not have been any different. </p>
<p>In all large monetary areas in the world, you have regions with low and even <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> negative developments in prices, and others with higher price developments. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-06-05</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>That it does not say that they are appropriate is not <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>. </p>
<p>But then, on the other hand, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well recall, I did push the door halfway open for a decision to be made at a later stage. </p>
<p>But if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> quote myself, I said," within a monetary union '' -- which the euro area is and which the United States is --" deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions '', like New Hampshire or Germany. </p>
<p>In the old days -- - if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> call them" old days '' now -- we always talked about the first and second pillar, as if there was a ranking. </p>
<p>I was already very clear when I said that I was <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> astonished at what the IMF has done, that is, publish a staff paper on inflation differentials and deflation in the euro area. </p>
<p>I beg you to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> me that I have no idea how long I will be here. </p>
<p>We are slightly less pessimistic <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> than the IMF. </p>
<p>As you noted in my presentation of the evaluation and <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> of the monetary policy strategy last month, and as you noted in my statement of today, we reversed the order in which we discussed the two pillars. </p>
<p>We are not inclined to give individual figures for some orders of magnitude or <span class='uncertainty'>variants</span> when you can not see them in the broader context of the all-encompassing projections as they will be in public. </p>
<p>And that in itself subtracts, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say, one impulse for the exchange rate movement we have witnessed in the last couple of months. </p>
<p>I can not quantify that, but you will be able to judge for yourself when next week you see our <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> projections, or I should say the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> projections by the staff of the ECB and all NCBs. </p>
<p>Well, as I said in my introduction, certainly the end of the war -- or the actual military activity in Iraq -- has, to a great extent, removed the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> that prevailed at the time, but as yet not totally. </p>
<p>That question I have already answered, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>But then, as I did in my Introductory Statement, I paid considerable attention to monetary developments and I extensively explained why we do not consider the very dynamic monetary developments -- as we see them -- as a threat that inflation <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> again be on its way up. </p>
<p>I think that we are credible enough for people to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we will deliver what we promise to deliver. </p>
<p>So you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say I explained that danger away with well-reasoned arguments. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say that we have achieved price stability by now. </p>
<p>Since, as you know, the strategy has not changed but merely been clarified, this decision would also have been taken had we not made this <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> public. </p>
<p>Lots of things are happening in <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all countries of the euro area, but admittedly this is too little and often too late in some countries, particularly the larger ones. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-07-10</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>Basically, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also include the imbalances that exist in the world on account of the fact that the large and fast growing economies in Asia broadly speaking have an exchange rate policy which links their currency to the US dollar, despite the fact that their economic developments are <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> very different from those in the United States. </p>
<p>Although also there, there are first signs -- but they are not yet very robust -- that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have reached the low point in confidence and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even already have passed it. </p>
<p>No, I very much welcome it, if it is indeed the first sign that confidence <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be returning. </p>
<p>We still think that it is the valid picture, as published in the June Monthly Bulletin, and we have no reason to <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> from it. </p>
<p>Well, this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a good opportunity to say exactly what I said when we met the trade union representatives. </p>
<p>The procedure is -LRB- and the dates are fixed -RRB- that on 15 July, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, the Ministers of Finance will formulate the proposal for the presidency of the ECB. </p>
<p>We are of the firm opinion that such <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> do not exist in the euro area. </p>
<p>We do not think so, because the yields have been rising and the differential between US long-term yields and European long-term yields has diminished <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> in that process. </p>
<p>I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that I will, and I do not intend to be a lame duck. </p>
<p>Together with the institutions of the European Communities and the Member States, we attach great importance to the protection of the Communities ' as well as the ECB 's financial interests and to efforts to combat fraud and other illegal activities that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be detrimental to the Communities ' as well as to the ECB 's financial interests. </p>
<p>The first feasible date after that decision of mid-October is -- and this is simply bureaucracy, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say -- not the day after, but two weeks later on 1 November. </p>
<p>As to your second question on the strategy, I would like to point out that the evaluation of the strategy was carried out by the entire Governing Council and was confirmed by the Governing Council, including, in all <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span>, my potential successor. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that. </p>
<p>I do not see that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> at all. </p>
<p>As you know, the ECB does not <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the budget of the Community. </p>
<p>The question was namely: does the regime, as set up by the European Regulation of 1999, apply to the ECB, or does that regime apply only to the European institutions and bodies that <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the budget of the Community? </p>
<p>If I refer to the most recent surveys of consumer and industrial confidence, they have at least stopped falling and there are first, albeit very <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span>, signs that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have reached the bottom and that confidence <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be returning, at last. </p>
<p>But I must confess that we saw with some relief that the strong appreciation which had been evident in the months before <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span>, at least for the time being, to have been interrupted. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> add that deviously they have also set a date for my regular hearing on 10 September. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-09-04</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this is broadly in line with the forecasts and projections of other institutions and the private sector. </p>
<p>Having said all this, having stated these conclusions, which I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> are strongly supported by the empirical evidence and experience, I think that we can add that in our view it will be conducive to growth to implement fiscal policies in the medium and long-term perspective and not in a way that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> impair the credibility of the fiscal framework of EMU. </p>
<p>Monetary policy decisions, as I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> you very well know, are taken on the basis of a mandate and in order to attain the clearly stated objectives of monetary policy. </p>
<p>And third, and more directly related to your question, is that the extent to which an expansionary fiscal policy can influence, can have positive effects on growth, <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> a lot on the overall fiscal position of a country, as well as on the extent to which it can strengthen consumer and investor confidence. </p>
<p>Now, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that these short-term considerations should not overshadow a number of other important facts and conclusions which are widely supported by evidence. </p>
<p>So our projection of an expected recovery <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on both external and domestic factors, but at the same time, as I acknowledged earlier, there are downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and some of the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are related to the strength and the pace of the global recovery. </p>
<p>On your first question regarding the effects of the interest rates on money demand: the situation, really, has not changed in any fundamental way because the demand for broad money <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the whole spectrum of interest rates. </p>
<p>These projections did take into account recent developments in all relevant <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, including the exchange rate. </p>
<p>Until the end of the year we expect inflation to hover close to or <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> slightly above 2%, in 2004 and 2005 to fall below 2%. </p>
<p>Well, regarding the first part of the question, I think the answer I gave a moment ago is quite relevant, that fiscal developments and prospects -- by influencing various economic <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> such as demand, prices and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> interest rates -- are taken into account when formulating our decisions. </p>
<p>And the increase in long-term yields -- which by the way is a very recent one -- does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have had any visible effects. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> expect some reversal in the future, at least a partial reversal, of the portfolio shifts observed in the past from assets outside M3 into assets that are included in M3. </p>
<p>And, looking forward, although we can conclude that growth in the present year will be, as I mentioned earlier, <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> below that previously envisaged, it does not change essentially the projected growth for the coming years. </p>
<p>But there is no scope for any ex ante co-ordination, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> call it that, of policies. </p>
<p>And there are, at the same time, positive upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- particularly associated with positive economic developments and prospects globally. </p>
<p>However, the final assessment <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on how it is financed and on this I do not have, at present, detailed information in order to be able to give you a precise judgement. </p>
<p>I said, more precisely, that the outcome will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the modalities of the financing and whether it will impinge on public finances in countries that are at present facing fiscal problems. </p>
<p>So the short answer is: it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>. </p>
<p>Now, in the future, for the future, one can make -- and I am now talking in general -- hypotheses on the basis of <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>I can say that for the year 2003, and taking into account developments during the first half of 2003, growth is expected to be <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> below the middle range of the projections we published in June. </p>
<p>And, as we meet every month, we <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> carefully and comprehensively the situation. </p>
<p>And I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is wise to make unconditional statements about the future. </p>
<p>So, on the basis of all these developments, but also taking into account developments in other <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, such as the price of oil -- which is an important consideration -- the decisions will be made in the future. </p>
<p>And if done appropriately and financed appropriately, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help to boost economic growth. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I should not make any comment that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be interpreted in any way as influencing decisions. </p>
<p>So, alternative scenarios can be contemplated on the basis of alternative <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> concerning the evolution of economic and monetary <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>. </p>
<p>It is an important factor, which adds to the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that exists and, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on developments, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> either boost or undermine confidence, which is an important element in supporting the pick-up in economic activity that we are projecting at present. </p>
<p>So I will make a general remark, which I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> to be appropriate and neutral. </p>
<p>And if it does, it will obviously increase the pressures and the problems associated with the excessive deficits that have been recorded in these countries and will make it more difficult to implement budgetary policies and so to bring the fiscal position in these countries closer to balance over the medium term, which -- as we stressed in the Statement and as I stressed separately earlier -- we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is going to contribute to rather than adversely affect economic growth. </p>
<p>I think you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> infer this from what I said. </p>
<p>I would point to two statements in the Introductory Statement which <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that, compared with two months ago -- so looking more to the past than to the future -- the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to output growth are judged at present to be diminished but not to have disappeared. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-10-02</b>, 11 sentences</p></div><p>Do you want to correct your article from this morning <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span>? </p>
<p>I have said that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are more or less balanced, both to the up and to the downside. </p>
<p>Well, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say even more about where the euro rate is today. </p>
<p>In the meantime, today Mr Solbes got from the Governing Council of the ECB all the support he <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> need for his further endeavours, he being the guardian of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>So, day-to-day movements do not -- <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> as a matter of principal -- influence our decisions. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that exchange rates in general should, over the medium or long term, reflect the economic fundamentals of the regions concerned. </p>
<p>The position of the Portuguese government -- and the position that I have also expressed myself publicly several times -- is that Portugal should not take advantage of this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<p>Well, that is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> I would be very happy to take. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it will be in that range. </p>
<p>But as you know, it is also in the regulations of the Pact that if the recession is over minus 0.75% this can create a <span class='uncertainty'>presumption</span> that the ECOFIN Council can consider this as a special circumstance. </p>
<p>So there is a reference here to a specific value, which is not an automatic guarantee that it will be accepted as a good reason for violating the 3%, but -- as is written in the regulations -- it creates the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-11-06</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>There are, I would say, pros and cons as regards this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> and we will look at these very, very carefully. </p>
<p>Lucas, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you elaborate on that? </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> a little bit after noon. </p>
<p>So the analysis of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and preparing yourself to respond to the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is really the rule of the game. </p>
<p>So we have a feeling that, by ensuring price stability and by taking the decisions we have taken in the past, we are really paving the way for, I would say, the financing of growth in Europe to be as easy as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> we can have the last three questions. </p>
<p>As regards the short-term evolution, we clearly see some reasons -- the very same reasons <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain -- why we would hover at that level, <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> at that level. </p>
<p>So we are introducing all the elements that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> play a role on the other side. </p>
<p>And it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that you have all the nuances that are appropriate in such a, of course, very important judgement that we have collectively made. </p>
<p>When looking ahead over the shorter term, it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that inflation rates <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> continue to hover around this level, 2,1%, for several months to come and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> thus not fall as quickly and strongly as had been expected up to the summer. </p>
<p>This expectation is based on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that wage developments will not be affected by the current inertia of the inflation rates and will remain moderate, even in the context of a gradual economic recovery, which -- as I have already said -- is our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>Of course, we are <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, we are pragmatic, we will see what the new data, the new facts, the new figures are. </p>
<p>If I look at the long-term perspective, I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the market is convinced that we will deliver that kind of stable long-term environment that is justifying low long and medium-term market rates conducive to growth and job creation. </p>
<p>In particular, we expressed our concerns that the envisaged reduction in the capital and restrictions on how profits are distributed and how provisions are made <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have implications for the financial independence of the central bank, and also, more generally, on its institutional independence. </p>
<p>As regards the European economy today -- and this is the assessment not only of the ECB, but also of other authorities, and here I am referring to the Lisbon consensus -- clearly we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that more efforts being made in research and development, in technology, in creativity, innovation and so forth, would permit more rapid progress in productivity and would, therefore, increase the growth potential, which -- as I have said -- is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> one of the main challenges that we have here in Europe today. </p>
<p>First of all, on the first question, which deals with the Stability and Growth Pact, I will say that we had a very clear position in the Governing Council, among the 18 members of the Governing Council, and you have it in writing, but I will repeat it because it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is important. </p>
<p>I would say only that we are observing at least three factors that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain this stickiness. </p>
<p>So until then I do not think it would be appropriate for us to make any further comments and <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about the outcome. </p>
<p>The third element <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be indirect taxation in a number of European economies. </p>
<p>As regards recent messages, I would not quote any particular currency, if you permit me, but as you know, it was made very, very clear by both Wim Duisenberg here, and by colleagues in the United States that the communiqué which was sent from Dubai was clear, without mentioning any particular currency, that we thought that some Asian currencies <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> progressively, smoothly and orderly appreciate over time. </p>
<p>Well, we all, of course, have assets and liabilities, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, chances and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the various continents, in the various big, or small, economies. </p>
<p>We are an institution that is already, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, a federal institution in the institutional framework. </p>
<p>On the one euro banknote we have already said that we would examine this particular question when we look at the new series of banknotes within <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> one year. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2003-12-04</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>I will only say that in the analysis of the ECB, of the Governing Council of the ECB, of the full body of the Eurosystem, and of -- to my knowledge and I am speaking with the Vice-President here -- all institutions, observers and academics analysing the situation, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> improve the growth potential if we were to embark as actively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> on the structural reforms we have mentioned. </p>
<p>We say what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have to say, and you are right in saying that we will not change our own vision. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the particular responsibility of central banks always to say more or less the same thing. </p>
<p>We say what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have to say and everybody will take responsibility for his own actions. </p>
<p>We trust, as I said, that investment will now <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be observed, and we trust that the growth that we have in mind, and that all observers have in mind, will be fostered by consumption, and also by investment. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> the first success of the euro. </p>
<p>What we have done until now -- and I repeat it because it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is important -- is to permit 305 million citizens of Europe to benefit from a financial environment with objectively low medium and long-term rates that did not exist before the euro. </p>
<p>Everybody knows what our benchmark is ; we give and display our definition of price stability ; everybody can see what the various data are that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have in mind ; and it is absolutely clear that we take our own decisions on the basis of our own responsibilities. </p>
<p>On the first point, I would say that we consider that this inertia of inflation over the next months -- and" next months '' <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> in fact mean several months -- is, as you have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, due to factors that would not necessarily be there were a certain period of time to elapse, and we consider that over the longer run we are in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>I know that it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be a little bit boring for you when you hear us repeating ourselves but it is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> better to repeat when you really <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is important. </p>
<p>I do not see at all what you are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> or alluding to. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I should once again like to say that it is up to all partners to <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> their responsibility and we firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is important to have this concept and this Treaty and Stability and Growth Pact framework. </p>
<p>I have already said that we encompass absolutely all data, all information, all elements that are of importance, so I would say that we have taken everything into consideration and we made a working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, as I said, that the commitments that were made by the countries concerned and the commitments that were made by the qualified majority of the Council are to be met 100%... that is of course our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>And the part for which we are responsible we try to deliver in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And our judgement is that confidence is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the most important ingredient at the present juncture, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so. </p>
<p>There are no indiscreet questions but only indiscreet answers, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> ! </p>
<p>And this is done by all central banks on both sides of the Atlantic, for instance, because it makes it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to gain the confidence of investors and savers. </p>
<p>You have seen what we said today, which is completely in line with what we had said before, as has already been mentioned, and we are sticking to our own analysis, where we have been as level-headed as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and where we have stated that we indeed <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what is in the Treaty and what is in the Stability and Growth Pact is very important for all the reasons that I have already mentioned. </p>
<p>We are as comprehensive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, as you know, in our economic analysis and we are also, and this is very important, never prisoner of a particular equation, of a particular system of equations, or of a particular algorithm. </p>
<p>It is very important to obtain this: very low <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premiums on the medium and long-term rates, in particular, and preserving or enforcing the favourable financial environment, which is of course one of the elements that is important for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>I have already said that: you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that a month ago I used -- if I am not mistaken -- the word" stickiness ''. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-01-08</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so, conceptually we are very close to the US in this respect. </p>
<p>In general, the ECB 's profitability is subject to considerable <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuations</span> due to large exchange-rate and interest-rate <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> arising from the structure of its balance sheet. </p>
<p>As I have said, we have a stake in financial stability and in stability in general and we have no particular preference for excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or excessive <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>As you know, we have in a way <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> this a little bit because the national central banks of those ten countries are already involved in the ESCB committees. </p>
<p>Well, I shall let you judge whether I am addressing recent events or less recent events when I say that we do not like excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> on the exchange markets. </p>
<p>By this I mean stability in general, and it is clear that we do not particularly like excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or excessive <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>We consider it a very important matter, a very important question, and of course, we will continue to meditate -- if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> put it like that -- but it is not our own responsibility. </p>
<p>I would not like to comment further on their entry into the ERM and then afterwards <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the euro. </p>
<p>And, as you know, the European concept is a decentralised concept whereby the national authorities have their responsibility and we have ourselves a particular mandate to pave the way for the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> functioning of that system. </p>
<p>Overall, having taken into account all the elements of the situation -- and they are very numerous, as I have said -- and all pertinent analyses, our conclusion was, as I have said, that we had sticky inflation, we had inertia in inflation, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> persist for some months, and that we would then see inflation clearly coming down in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>So we were not particularly satisfied with what I called the excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or excessive <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> or excessive shifts in general. </p>
<p>This is not, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say, a scoop. </p>
<p>I have already mentioned the fact that we do not like excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in general and that we had a stake in stability and stability in the exchange market as well as financial stability in general. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span>, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> respond to the first question and ship the second to Lucas, if he wants it. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> we need a little more confidence. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this set of sound and reasonable policies is one of the necessary conditions for markets and exchange rates to be stable. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-02-05</b>, 8 sentences</p></div><p>This is a prouesse -LSB- amazing achievement -RSB- on the part of the euro, because, as I have already said, the markets and global observers did not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in 1997 and 1998 that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> deliver a new currency that would be as credible as the best legacy currencies. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that all we can do to communicate this element of confidence to the households is very important. </p>
<p>It is important for us to <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> take advantage of this press conference to say that households in Europe should not be frightened by the fact that we are tackling necessary structural reforms. </p>
<p>And you have a number of other improvements that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly be made and that would be welcome. </p>
<p>And from that standpoint, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we have a number of indicators which are encouraging. </p>
<p>The implementation of that secondary legislation and of that Treaty <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be improved, along the lines that have been <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Solbes, taking account, in particular, but not only, of the fact that structural analyses complementing nominal analyses are very useful. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the secondary legislation, namely the Stability and Growth Pact itself, the wording of the Pact, should not be changed. </p>
<p>This makes <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> what we have today -- a fantastic asset of the European economy -- namely a financial environment which is very favourable, with medium and long-term interest rates that are very favourable and -- I would say -- are" crystallising '' the performance of the best legacy currencies prior to the euro. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-03-04</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>Some criticisms implicitly go in the direction: you should be <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a little bit less orthodox, quote unquote. </p>
<p>And it is, of course, for the US to look at it in the most appropriate manner <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And we firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have inflation under control and that our definition of price stability is being reached. </p>
<p>We know that we are in an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> universe and that we have to go through all detailed scientific analysis and then make our own judgement. </p>
<p>We know that it will increase on account of base effects over the months to come, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>. </p>
<p>We feel it is our responsibility to tell the citizens, our fellow citizens, you can have confidence, we are here, the situation is under control, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more so than you think. </p>
<p>And we try to be confidence-inspiring, as I say, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this to be very important. </p>
<p>Confidence is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the ingredient which is still a little bit lacking in some constituencies, particularly in the household constituency, in the consumer constituency. </p>
<p>We are observing, as we say, a certain <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, up and down, of yearly inflation on a month-to-month basis. </p>
<p>You can see in the results of our discussion in Boca Raton a number of elements which <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> give evidence of the fact that we had a fruitful and friendly meeting with results. </p>
<p>We examine the situation every month, and every month each member of the Governing Council rightly considers that we have to discuss the full context of the situation, including all data and analyses, with the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of concluding in any direction. </p>
<p>But I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that on the whole the prospects are good, that this ratification will be concluded on time, before the end of the month. </p>
<p>That 's the organisation of Europe, and I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is a good organisation. </p>
<p>We know in advance that for statistical reasons it will go up again, and then <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you will say: today you should do this, and tomorrow you should do that. </p>
<p>There is no other central bank, we are the only one -- I draw your attention to that -- which immediately after having considered the situation, and under the observation of the full body of European and global observers and journalists, produces its own assessment of the situation and asks the Vice-President and the President to <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in front of you and to respond as candidly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to the questions on the decision which has just been taken. </p>
<p>As you have mentioned yourself, we have a great number of indicators, and we have a great number of indicators which are <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>So we have to take everything into consideration and not only the early indicators that are related to, for instance, the economic cycle and the last indication we have of domestic demand, but also all indicators of inflation and what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen as far as inflation is concerned. </p>
<p>What we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in is that when a government embarks upon bold and courageous structural reforms, as has been the case of a number of governments, it is good for everybody, for the full body of society. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> perceived inflation or the absence of sufficient confidence in price stability play a dampening role in this respect. </p>
<p>We said very clearly that for some areas in the world there was <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a good reason for a certain re-balancing. </p>
<p>We are confident in the medium run, we have to remain as vigilant, alert and pragmatic as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So you can trust us to have looked at today 's case on the basis of the situation today, as I have explained, as thoroughly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And it is, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, our duty to explain that and tell the general public that, because we are undertaking a reform, it should improve confidence, as it is something which benefits everyone. </p>
<p>When you look at the evolution after we spoke, you can see that, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, the message has been <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> incorporated in the behaviour of the market as something important. </p>
<p>But again, I would sum up by saying that we are proud, we are convinced, that it is good for Europe and we are convinced that this is a professional challenge of the first magnitude to be sure that we optimising their integration, including <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> with appropriate professional preparation for ERM II, for instance, at the present juncture. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we have the feeling, which exists in a number of households, that with the situation <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> from one economy to another, perceived inflation is higher than it is in reality and that future inflation <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be higher than we trust it will be. </p>
<p>If I take into account all the reflections on this matter by the Governing Council, I would say that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> we are devoting right now in between a quarter or a third of our time to the enlargement issue, so as to gain a better understanding of the situation of each of these particular countries. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> one day you will tell me: inflation is at this level, you should do this. </p>
<p>Then you can adopt, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I would say, a more positive attitude as regards consumption and investment. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-04-01</b>, 57 sentences</p></div><p>To them, and only for the part of the consumption which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be hampered by this sentiment, to them we say: we are there to be the good guardian of the currency. </p>
<p>If the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability were to change, then we would change our own monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>First question: I have already explained that we wanted to be as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you are exaggerating the semantic meaning. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> it was something felt by a part of the market, but it was not what we intended to communicate. </p>
<p>One of the reasons which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> more on us is that consumers in Europe feel that their purchasing power is hampered, because they have a perceived inflation higher than real inflation. </p>
<p>We incorporate everything and we would change our monetary policy stance upwards or downwards on the basis of this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> analysis. </p>
<p>It does not mean that we can not change this policy stance if we have new information and if the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability changes. </p>
<p>And all this, put together, leads us to the conclusion that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a gradual recovery is the appropriate diagnosis at the present moment. </p>
<p>But the fact that we said it was appropriate a month ago did not mean that a month ago -- and I have to say this because it is important that our dialogue is as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- we were excluding anything in the months to come. </p>
<p>So, we work and we will give our opinion as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen in the diagnosis that I read a moment ago, we mention consumption and consumer confidence and we mention a number of elements that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain why it is not as robust and dynamic as would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be the case if we had a recovery which were less gradual. </p>
<p>Again, we are more explicit and I hope that you understand <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a little bit better what our permanent attitude is, which is that we have a magnetic north in our compass and incorporate all the information that comes in, to the extent, of course, that it is pertinent and informative. </p>
<p>Again, what we do is analyse, as comprehensively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, every month -- as we did this month -- the overall situation. </p>
<p>We look at the situation with a view to weighing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> raise or lower rates, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on this very comprehensive analysis. </p>
<p>We wanted to be as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> about our present analysis, and that is the reason why we were more explicit. </p>
<p>The rates would not be as low as they are if <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia were incorporated to take account of inflationary expectations over and above our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>By ensuring and being credible that we are correctly assessing this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we contribute massively to helping Europe, because we give credit to the very low market rates that we are currently delivering. </p>
<p>It is also clear, as you noted, that I said that we knew we would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have a hump in the HICP in the months to come. </p>
<p>At the present moment, we do not modify our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a gradual recovery and we consider that nothing goes against this overall, taking all figures, data, surveys and hard figures into account, and so we do not change our vision. </p>
<p>But the fact that we cross-check with the monetary analysis on a longer-term perspective, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, ensures a better anchoring of long-term expectations for inflation. </p>
<p>And we explained why, despite the fact that there is very abundant liquidity, it does not drive us to consider that we have to change the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>In our monetary policy concept, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this cross-checking is very important. </p>
<p>Again, I explain that we were in a position to analyse the situation as comprehensively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>If we have a low level of interest rates, it is not due to a <span class='uncertainty'>random</span> behaviour of markets ; it is because we were skilful enough to pass on the best yield curve available in the euro area before the euro, to the euro. </p>
<p>Again, as I have said, we look at it every month on the basis of the full body of information available and we analyse this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I mentioned that they were in some respects mixed but, overall, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they do not lead us to change our overall assessment of the gradual recovery. </p>
<p>We would explain candidly -- as transparently as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- our monetary policy. </p>
<p>Namely that we do not see at the present moment anything <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> a significant impact. </p>
<p>We have to assess the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, which is the magnetic north of our compass. </p>
<p>We try to be as comprehensive and to understand as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and we go then through our own balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And if we were abandoning our magnetic north, then <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia would <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> and we would have higher, not lower, interest rates. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that through price stability we can help to considerably improve the situation, the economic situation of Europe. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> the overall environment has been quite negative at a certain moment, more positive at another moment, which is understandable, because it is a gradual recovery and we have mixed signals. </p>
<p>If the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> changes, we can change -- <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the decision of the Governing Council -- our own monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>All the other elements contribute to this balance ; they include of course aggregate demand, which is a major element that we have to incorporate into this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And we said that we <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> improve the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact without changing the wording. </p>
<p>Of course, from time to time, for reasons that I can explain to myself very well, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have an amplification of one sentence and the reverse attitude for other sentences. </p>
<p>It is clear if aggregate demand is much stronger or weaker, then the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability changes and we are legitimate in changing our interest rates, whether it is up or down. </p>
<p>But do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the previous" appropriate '' would mean no change in the future, in the many months to come, for a very long period of time. </p>
<p>We do not exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that such an impact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come, so we have again, in this domain as well as in others, to remain ready to incorporate any new information. </p>
<p>We the ECB, we the Governing Council of the ECB, the Treaty itself and all the people of Europe who have ratified the Treaty, we all <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that price stability is a necessary condition for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>But what we mean is that it has to go through the grid of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, taking everything into account, as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We stressed that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> our present stance of policy is exactly in line with that goal, and we note that it is obviously helping, because we have the lowest interest rates in 50 years. </p>
<p>It is always this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we are weighing. </p>
<p>We said exactly what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> on the basis, again, of our present analysis. </p>
<p>The balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> I am referring to is always a balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, which is the ultimate decision-making step. </p>
<p>We have an analysis of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, which leads us to the conclusion that the present level of interest rates is the kind of level which ensures price stability. </p>
<p>We conduct a full examination of the situation through our own grid of analysis -- namely, what is the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, incorporating all elements. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is important for you to know that. </p>
<p>And we feel very much akin to those central banks that want to incorporate all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> elements. </p>
<p>I have no comment on what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be done in the case you mention since it is the responsibility of the executive branches to reflect on this particular question. </p>
<p>And I firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is very important to be as convincing as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in explaining how our economy works and why we would be better off in all respects -- growth, job creation, prosperity. </p>
<p>And as I said, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go up or we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go down. </p>
<p>As regards the position that we have expressed, we <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that it was necessary to explain even more explicitly what our policy diagnosis was, and I quote -- as it has been analysed very carefully --" on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have not changed our assessment that the current stance of monetary policy remains in line with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term ''. </p>
<p>I have already mentioned that we were as comprehensive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-05-06</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>So, as you have been mentioning, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the Bundesbank said something, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the Banque de France said something. </p>
<p>We have noted, of course, that oil prices and commodity prices represent a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but nevertheless we consider that, over time, we have inflation under control. </p>
<p>I only wanted to mention that as a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but the level of oil and commodities prices that we have observed during the last weeks does not change at all the assessment that global growth is very robust, as I said, and is helping the economies of the entire world to be in an environment which is favourable to growth. </p>
<p>We analyse that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>It is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>As you know, the reason why there is a consensus in Europe on structural reforms -- and we are very keen to communicate this element of the European consensus -- is precisely because we trust that those structural reforms will permit an increase in the growth potential of Europe, which is below what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be observed if we had the structural reforms. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> less simple, unfortunately, to deliver for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>From this and all other elements and inputs that we had, we came to the conclusion that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability were balanced. </p>
<p>We are seeing this already now, with the latest information, and I mentioned that we <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> would have inflation over 2% in the next months to come. </p>
<p>They are also very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>As regards inflation, as I said one, two, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> even three months ago, we expect a hump in inflation in the months to come. </p>
<p>So all I can say is that we have exactly the same analysis as regards the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>On the first point, I would only say that we are welcoming Governor Liikanen when he comes -- I have already paid homage to Mr Louekoski and his invitation, and spoken about Matti Vanhala -- and we are absolutely sure that we will work in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> fashion with Mr Liikanen. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-06-03</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>So, I would prefer <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> for you to have the full explanation of the projections, with all the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> that have been made, immediately after this press conference. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that some of you expressed <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about this some months ago: I had to answer a lot of questions about whether we were right in making that working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a gradual recovery. </p>
<p>I would say that all the data we have so far have confirmed that it was an appropriate working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, particularly for the first quarter. </p>
<p>And for all decision-makers and for all responsible institutions -- and central banks are, of course, fully part of this constituency -- decision-making is decision-making in an environment of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>So, again, it is absolutely clear that we have to take into account the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> we are in. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the combination of past decisions -- which we <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> took against strong advice to the contrary -- and vigilance -- which is, as we say, of the essence now -- will permit us to deliver what it is our duty to deliver. </p>
<p>But, that being said, the information received <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> continue to be mixed and we continue to be very, very keen on analysing the new data and information and on being vigilant. </p>
<p>And while I will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> respond directly to a question on oil, which is part of the issue today, I am responding here to the general environment of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> remain the only ones among comparable central banks to have a press conference in order to be as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and as transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that this growth -- which has been observed for the first quarter -- has exceeded expectations. </p>
<p>So, we are in a situation where we consider our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of recovery to have been confirmed. </p>
<p>On other sides, for example the PMI, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have observed that the recent indication on the industry side -- and the most recent indication today on the services side -- have been quite encouraging, signalling that a recovery is under way. </p>
<p>On your second question on the dilemma of any central bank, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I remind you once again: we are responsible for price stability. </p>
<p>There is an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the oil area but also in a number of other areas. </p>
<p>But what we can say is that we urge the oil producers and all partners to maintain the highest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> level of responsibility in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>So, by being as vigilant and credible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in delivering price stability in the medium and long run, we make a decisive contribution to growth and job creation. </p>
<p>We said that our overall analysis of the situation was such that we judged it inopportune to go in the direction that had been <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> at the time, and I would say that most of what we said proved to be well-founded. </p>
<p>I must say, on a personal basis, because we have no Governing Council position in this respect, that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me very opportune to eliminate all kind of <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span> as regards the facts in this domain as well as in all others. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is extremely important for any central bank, and I would say in particular for the ECB, to firmly anchor medium and long-term expectations. </p>
<p>As regards the monetary analysis, first of all, you remember that when we clarified and communicated our monetary policy strategy, we explained at length why we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is important to have a monetary analysis, why the monetary analysis is based very much upon our utmost conviction that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. </p>
<p>The decisions on the monetary policy stance are based upon a final judgement on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>And if we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go in this direction I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we would all be better off: of course, first of all the countries concerned and certainly the Eurosystem and the European Union as a whole -- the remark was, if my memory is correct, about the European Union as a whole -- and I can tell you that it is also a recommendation which is made by this institution to all countries. </p>
<p>I will say that it is our collective and collegial responsibility to have ERM II function in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> way. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in both directions and that is why we have to be very vigilant and alert, and keen to get all new information and to introduce this new information into our own assessments. </p>
<p>So we have to be prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember what you were asking for in your questions here only a few months ago? </p>
<p>We are speaking of the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> functioning of ERM II and whether it was ERM I or ERM II we have never embarked on a policy of pre-announcing or pre-commenting <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future decisions. </p>
<p>But we did have such analyses and you can imagine what the various consequences of various <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> scenarios would be. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have this scenario you are mentioning as well as others. </p>
<p>We are in a world of a high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>In that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> environment what counts is that you take decisions that are wise and robust, namely that they are as optimal as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, having worked through various <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> representations of an extremely complex reality that can not be summed up with any level of pertinence by a single mathematical economic model. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the growth and credibility of this working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a gradual recovery, which is materialising, I do not want to say more than I have already said. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-07-01</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p>So you have a number of signals that we are going in the direction of the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>We all agree on the necessity of these structural reforms and the problem is to implement those structural reforms, which is being done in some countries before your eyes, and before the eyes of the Governing Council, but which is obviously not very easy because of the sentiment of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> part of the population because of the fact that public opinion in general <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> has yet to understand why it would be extremely important to make those reforms if we want growth, job creation and diminishing unemployment. </p>
<p>Frankly speaking, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that all the criticism about the absence of transparency of the ECB can be taken with a grain of salt. </p>
<p>Outside Europe, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have mentioned Australia, which is a country that has introduced a lot of structural reforms on the basis very largely of a political consensus, and also of a social consensus, and these reforms are paying off also very well. </p>
<p>For instance, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have mentioned Ireland, which is in the euro zone and is certainly a success story in terms of growth, in terms of GDP per capita and in terms of job creation, and again it is in the euro zone. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have mentioned other countries myself. </p>
<p>First comment: there is a consensus in Europe, as extraordinary as it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span>, on what you said, on the fact that it would be extremely opportune to embark on structural reforms and to do things that some other economies have already been doing over the past years. </p>
<p>So we trust that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> -- I say <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, I am <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, I am prudent -- our monetary policy concept is well-suited to this particular responsibility that is part of the overall BIS remark. </p>
<p>It is certainly our collective duty to explain better, but there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we all agree on the direction to be taken. </p>
<p>We consider that on top of the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> interaction between asset inflation and <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> bubbles and the monetary policy oriented towards price stability, which is the rule of the game for all central banks, we are keen ourselves on having a monetary analysis. </p>
<p>So, not only do we try to be as transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> but also we, more or less, contributed to changing, for the sake of transparency, the state of the art of communication in central banking. </p>
<p>Everything we have as far as our own analysis is concerned is telling us that all things being equal -- and, of course, do not forget that we are living in a universe where there is a lot of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> -- in the short term inflation will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be higher than 2% until the end of the year and even higher than 2% for part of the first semester of next year. </p>
<p>First of all, the BIS is an international institution which is important, with a close relationship, as you know, with central banks and which is there precisely to ask pertinent questions or to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> further deliberations in important areas at the global level because it is a fully international institution. </p>
<p>And we trust that it is a way not only to better anchor inflationary expectations, because in the long run inflation is a monetary phenomenon, but also a way of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> taking more closely into account phenomena like asset inflation and bubbles because they are fed by monetary expansion. </p>
<p>It is clear that there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>: you have exactly the same figures, the same data, you know the environment, you see that the present level of CPI is 2.4 when it was 2.5 last month, you know our definition of price stability of less than but close to 2%. </p>
<p>We are in a symmetrical position -- I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that the Federal Reserve would not respond by saying" Yes, we are under the influence of the ECB, if they do this, we would do that ''. </p>
<p>And then we take a decision, which has to be explained to you as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So I would interpret such ideas as aiming at having the best functioning <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> of the executive branches within their own constituencies and of the Commission itself. </p>
<p>I will not comment on that, I do not see how there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a counterweight to the ECB. </p>
<p>That being said, our judgement on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability is -- for all the reasons I have explained -- balanced. </p>
<p>First, again, I repeat -- and you will pardon me if I say something I said already here -- we have an economic analysis and then a monetary analysis, and then we have a judgement on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>And we have a number of elements to substantiate that, particularly the fact that the private sector, private observers, have more or less <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> upwards their overall judgement on growth in this economy, and particularly in the present year 2004. </p>
<p>We also have to say that in the medium term we consider that price stability will be in line with our own definition, but it is obvious that we have to take into account a number of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and that is the reason why vigilance is warranted. </p>
<p>All elements have to be taken into account and, as you know, at any time there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be changes. </p>
<p>The judgement we have on the gradual recovery proceeding is something which is part of our own economic analysis, which again has an impact on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>We operate in a universe where we have to take account of everything and make a synthesis out of everything we have, to be sure that our decisions are robust and that they really take account of everything, including the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, which is part of our very comprehensive deliberations. </p>
<p>And also the credibility of our monetary policy concept, which -- at the beginning -- was <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> criticised a little but it is now less and less criticised, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>That has made it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to generalise for 306 million inhabitants a level of market interest rates that was previously the privilege of only a fraction of those 306 million inhabitants. </p>
<p>The credibility, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, of the transparent interaction with you and, through you, with the full body of observers, savers and investors. </p>
<p>So, on the judgement we have on growth, I would say that what we are observing now and what we have observed during the last months, goes in the direction of a confirmation of our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a gradual recovery. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-09-02</b>, 35 sentences</p></div><p>Upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are present and visible. </p>
<p>So, what we publish does not confirm your <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>Again, we undoubtedly have to take into account these events, which nobody was able to foresee, if you look at previous <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>And this level of credibility is entirely <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span>, in the eyes of all observers and, I trust, of yourselves and the market participants, on our vigilance. </p>
<p>This to explain why we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this strong vigilance is appropriate in the present circumstances and is helping to preserve this favourable environment and therefore growth. </p>
<p>What I have said on this impact <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be true for the euro area economy. </p>
<p>So what we are observing, namely that there are indeed differences in economic behaviour and in inflation from country to country in our own continental economy in the euro area, is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> something natural in such a wide continental economy. </p>
<p>It is so, after taking into account a great amount of input, including the fact that for this year, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, the first quarter was better than expected and the second quarter was, in some cases, also a little better. </p>
<p>It is also true for inflation, and academic research has <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> that, when you look at the overall level of inflation in our own economy and in the other big economy that I have mentioned, we see that the orders of magnitude of the overall dispersion of inflation from state to state <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be considered very similar. </p>
<p>I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> confirms what our previous judgement was and what our present judgement is on this gradual recovery which is gradually materialising. </p>
<p>But for the moment our <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> position is what I have said it is. </p>
<p>But you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that this was more or less questioned by a number of observers, which would have recommended doing this and that on the basis of a judgement which was less optimistic. </p>
<p>We are confident, as I said, that we will go back to our definition of price stability next year on the basis of our present <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, i.e. that wages and salaries are moderate, that there are no second-round effects from the increases in the price of oil, that there are no nasty surprises regarding the price of oil in comparison with our <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, which are based, as you know, on futures markets, and that there are no bad surprises regarding indirect taxes and administrative taxes, which have been responsible, this year and in previous years, for some increases. </p>
<p>That being said, of course, I think it is important to understand why we are observing those differences and, of course, to do all that can be done -- both by the various interested parties and particularly, of course, the governments themselves and the parliaments and social partners -- to understand why we are observing certain things and why, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, on a country-to-country basis, improvements would be appropriate. </p>
<p>Again, as I said, these are <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> observations and we have to be very precise, very professional in such matters, which are highly technical. </p>
<p>Again, I must be clear on the fact that what I am mentioning are only provisional and <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> observations. </p>
<p>In all very large economies that I know -- and after all I know at least this one, the euro area, and another one which is <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> the same size -- in these kinds of continental, very large economies you have, and you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have, and we are observing, from time to time, substantial differences from country to country, from state to state, from, economy to economy, You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> very well have a boom in one place while you have difficult periods in another, and I do n't want to cite any particular economy in Europe, but we all have in mind such examples. </p>
<p>As I said, our present position, which is only a <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span>, provisional position, because we are waiting for the official proposal of the Commission -- and for that of the Council, which will decide as a last resort -- is that our <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span>, provisional observations are fully in line with what we have said before. </p>
<p>But, we again have to be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We also think that the timetable for the monitoring process, again in the" preventive arm '', <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be improved so that stability and convergence programmes and their assessment would better guide domestic budgetary processes. </p>
<p>So we are confident, on the basis of our present <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, and vigilant, because it is something which is not only our duty but which stems from the present situation. </p>
<p>And we also think, again, provisionally, that taking into account the cycle and the structural aspects of the situation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be, in the preventive arm, an important improvement as regards the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> bring us back to an earlier question. </p>
<p>We take it that improvements in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be made. </p>
<p>One of the most frequent observations which is made about the Stability and Growth Pact is that we have problems in difficult times because the system is not, in its implementation of the preventive arm framework, sufficiently <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> when things are going well. </p>
<p>We maintain our rates as they are and we are pretty vigilant, because there are upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>And on a number of points we feel that some improvements <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> really be effective: in particular, as regards the" preventive arm '' of the Pact, where we think that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> strengthen the incentives for compliance" in good times ''. </p>
<p>I do not want to overemphasise the messages we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> send, but I feel that they were part of the overall confidence rebuilding. </p>
<p>At the time when we had had the feeling that consumption, household consumption in particular, was very weak, abnormally weak, and that part of this weakness was due to, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, the sentiment that inflation would hamper purchasing power in the household constituency in future, we had said to households that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be confident, that we were there, that we were the guardian of the currency and that we would take care of this threat that some households <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> felt looming. </p>
<p>I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> what is likely or not likely to be decided tomorrow by the European Commission. </p>
<p>The figures I have -- again, this needs to be checked very carefully -- but the figures I have would <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate a reduction from 59% in 1971 to 42% in 2000. </p>
<p>I was <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, I am <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because we have <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that have to be considered, both for growth and for inflation. </p>
<p>I do not want to qualify the situation in other parts of the world, but it also <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be reasonably true for other major economies in the world, notably for the sister economy I have mentioned. </p>
<p>We, of course, also have the past appreciation of the euro, which -- as I have also mentioned -- has <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> contributed to the fact that the impact <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been smaller than it would otherwise have been. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that the reversal of past portfolio shifts is proceeding more slowly -- and I trust that this is exactly your point -- than would have been expected on the basis of historical evidence. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-10-07</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>We also have downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, to the extent that the new environment that we have had since the two meetings is clearly influenced by the fact that we have had a bad evolution as regards the price of oil. </p>
<p>The Bank of Greece provided all the figures which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be estimated on the basis of the information available. </p>
<p>On the first point, as you know, we are as comprehensive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in our economic analysis. </p>
<p>We are also of the sentiment that further comprehensive labour market reforms <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help considerably to improve job creation. </p>
<p>To sum up our view in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, it is clear that we still have upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, that is absolutely clear. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth -- upward or downward -- I would not say that we have changed our judgement substantially or significantly. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that this has led to some underestimations compared to what we were really observing. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the eyes of the full body of the Governing Council, the reflection of our understanding of the situation. </p>
<p>The Governing Council is expected to discuss and evaluate the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> designs of the three prize-winning competitors in the middle of November. </p>
<p>So, again, I would not express anything on any particular country but I would say -- as it was mentioned by ECOFIN -- that we must have stable figures which are not <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on electoral or political cycles. </p>
<p>And that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> has certainly increased <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> in line with what we have observed in this domain. </p>
<p>No decision has been taken either by the Governing Council or the Executive Board concerning these <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> plans, which have not yet been submitted to the decision-making bodies. </p>
<p>Over the last few months the three prize-winning architects from the architectural design competition that was completed in the spring have been preparing <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> plans which aim to meet fully the requirements of the ECB and to address certain recommendations of the jury of the architectural design competition. </p>
<p>As you know, I read it and it will be available of course as part of our overall introductory remarks, but I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> nevertheless read it again:" It is of vital importance to the credibility of the budgetary surveillance that the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured. </p>
<p>So these are the facts, and any <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> concerning <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> choices is unfounded because decisions have not yet been taken and the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> plans have not yet been assessed. </p>
<p>The information that we have today when I look at everything would confirm that sentiment, but I remain of course <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because we are expecting the full report of Eurostat to definitely clarify the situation. </p>
<p>So, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is certainly a major issue for central bankers. </p>
<p>So we take all parameters into account, including, of course, what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come from commodities in general. </p>
<p>Seen from the perspective of the medium and long-term inflationary expectations, we trust that, in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and we trust that our two-pillar approach is precisely what permits us <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> to be more assured that our medium and long-term inflationary expectations are fully in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>I refer also to the G7 Communiqué from Washington which is calling for all partners to be as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It is also true that the oil price increases are so important and visible that they <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have a tendency to hide other commodity increases a little, elements that are there and that we have to take into account. </p>
<p>It is not something which, in our opinion, fits with the idea of encouraging the best behaviour <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But I do not want to elaborate on the economic reasoning behind this, namely that if you have less debt then you are at an advantage because you have less service of the debt and more room for manoeuvre than other countries ; and why encourage a country to go on piling up debt until it reaches 60% when that particular country <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be much better off with less debt? </p>
<p>I would add that, when I was in Washington on the occasion of the recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, I participated on behalf of the ECB in the deliberations and discussions of the G7, and you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have seen that in the G7 Communiqué we called upon oil producers to be as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I referred to the relative stability of the figures that we had observed in the past, while they were far more <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> in the United States. </p>
<p>It is clear that there is a nuance there and that, if we had the price of oil remaining at this level, it would confirm that we have a downward <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that would be <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more tangible. </p>
<p>To sum up the situation as <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span> as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, I would say that there is no need for alarm at this stage. </p>
<p>In French I would say" chance '', the chance of there being upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth, but we will have to see whether they materialise. </p>
<p>That having been said, we are also making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the present price figures will not necessarily last for long. </p>
<p>And, as regards the corrective arm of the Pact, we have said clearly both that we would call for the Treaty and the Regulations not to be changed and that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it to be extremely important to retain the nominal anchor of 3%. </p>
<p>I do not want to elaborate too much on that again, because we still have the same position and because I have reiterated on behalf of the Governing Council that very same position, namely that we are on board for improvement and implementation as regards, in particular, the preventive arm of the Pact, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span>, of course, on careful examination of the very precise orientations that would be retained by the Council of Ministers of Finance, which is the responsible body. </p>
<p>I also refer to the statement of the Minister of Finance, who knows the available data and who recently stated that there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the country fulfilled at the time the criteria. </p>
<p>But we remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-11-04</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>And so, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> imagine that you have solved the problem for your first year, but then with your second, your third, your fourth, etc., you have the same problem without the means to solve it. </p>
<p>And we also decided to embark on a swap of 50 billion dollars with the Federal Reserve System in order to be able to deliver dollars in Europe to cope with <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> problems of counterparties in New York. </p>
<p>Each of us participated in the discussion and we weighed up the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>So I warn you that there is the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span>, as far as we understand the consequences and, I would say, the passing-through of the oil price impact that we will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> see. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Almost</span> one year ago I said that excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements on exchange markets were undesirable. </p>
<p>The weight of the upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability was assessed. </p>
<p>Thus we all signed, and I signed in particular, the sentence stating that" excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth ''. </p>
<p>I told you that I stick to what I said on excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>At the present time, I would say that what is clear to me is that the present pick-up of the CPI which we are observing will continue for some months and will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even increase. </p>
<p>It is clear that we see these upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability augmenting. </p>
<p>It is our duty ; we are there to ensure price stability ; we are there to deliver price stability ; we are there to permit all economic agents to make the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that price stability will be delivered over time -- not just, as I used to say, on a two-year or a five-year basis, but on a ten-year or even a 30-year basis, because a number of Treasuries are issuing Treasury bonds on a 30-year basis. </p>
<p>I remain very prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and I will not respond to the question on the average of next year. </p>
<p>The working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> when I was mentioning the profile that I had in mind is that the price of oil would remain at the same level. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> so much on the oil price itself and what is likely or unlikely to happen and I do n't want to make any projections. </p>
<p>On the first question, I am very clear and I do n't want to repeat again the fact that excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly moves in the exchange markets are undesirable. </p>
<p>On the second question I will be very clear: the terms" excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> '' and" disorderly movements '' speak for themselves. </p>
<p>We have a joint interest in both our economies for this to be managed as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>First of all, because we are" there '' as regards inflation and, as I have already said, we are strongly vigilant and -- and this is a reason why we did not increase rates today -- we take it that the situation, the overall balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, is such that we have the maintenance of price stability over time in hand. </p>
<p>So under this <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> it is absolutely clear that downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth are there and are rising. </p>
<p>If you are not credible in delivering price stability and inflationary expectations increase, then you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> see a generalisation of those second-round effects. </p>
<p>I would only say and confirm that there is a consensus in the G7 communiqué to signal that some currencies -- not the particular currency that we are talking about here, i.e. the Chinese currency, but a number of currencies in Asia -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly be allowed to appreciate, to some extent, by market forces, in a progressive, orderly and smooth fashion, which is not the case today. </p>
<p>I will not elaborate on whether or not it announces anything else, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> ask the Governor of the Bank of China and the Chinese authorities. </p>
<p>In reply to your second question, it is absolutely clear that under a working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the price of oil remains at the present level and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even rise further, which is a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we hate but that we have mentioned, clearly the impact on inflation is upward and the impact on growth is downward. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2004-12-02</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>We are also very much <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the global evolution. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is one of the main tools that we have to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Each of us weighs up all the pros and cons for the various <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take. </p>
<p>I will not embark on a" hit parade '' of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> in which we are living, we ourselves in the Governing Council of the ECB and also at the level of all responsible entities, not only in Europe but all over the world. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you have noted that in what I have said today in my introductory remarks there are four paragraphs that concern our understanding of what is happening on the monetary side. </p>
<p>What Lucas <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not necessarily say but what I will say is that, when I look at the report of the Bank of Greece for the time in question, I see that the Bank of Greece had reported both the deficit figures based on" delivery '' -LRB- national accounting -RRB- -- we are entering into technicalities here -- and the figures based on" cash payments ''. </p>
<p>As you know, when we clarified our monetary policy concept, which was done in 2003, we said that the reference value of 4.5%, which of course exists, was a medium-term reference value, so we would not <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the reference value every year. </p>
<p>We in the Governing Council of the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that in the long term inflation is a monetary phenomenon and we have the impression that this is also regarded by academics and by observers in general as something which is very important. </p>
<p>And, as I have said, we are looking at the monetary gap that we are experiencing and we are trying to gain a better understanding of a phenomenon which I mentioned earlier, namely the fact that the portfolio shifts observed previously have not reversed, in our opinion, in the way that they normally <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do or should do at this point in the cycle. </p>
<p>I do not make a" hit parade '' of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> but we have to continue, as we have been until now, to be an" anchor of stability ''. </p>
<p>The Council itself -- and we fully approve of this -- said that" we should not be <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on electoral cycles or political influence ''. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> refer partly to what we extract from index bonds and the extraction from index bonds gives figures that are a little bit over and above 2%, and this is something that we have to examine very carefully. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see, as regards the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem, this has been taken into account at a certain level which is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>So, it is clear that the oil price is an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that we have to take into account. </p>
<p>You see that the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> of the present Eurosystem staff projections are different from the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> of the previous projections that we published three months ago, only because the environment changes. </p>
<p>As you know, the English language comes partly from the Anglo-Normand and you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that it is the Anglo-Normand style. </p>
<p>And we take all pertinent information into account, including the evolution of domestic demand, the evolution of the economy and all other elements, as part of our own judgement of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, both through the economic analysis and through the monetary analysis. </p>
<p>And if inflation expectations remain in line with price stability, this paves the way for no second-round effects, for all economic agents to make the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that in the medium run we will be in line with price stability, and for a financial environment which is extremely favourable. </p>
<p>As everybody can see, we are also living in an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> world as regards a number of other parameters, of course exchange rates, of course the overall attitude of authorities that are responsible for structural reforms, that are responsible for fiscal policies. </p>
<p>We have an idea of the global evolution, but there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at the global level that we have to take into account. </p>
<p>We have to be such an anchor in an environment which is obviously <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>, and which is changing. </p>
<p>And it is true that we are living in an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> world. </p>
<p>As you know, as member of the international community, we are calling for oil markets to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and for this price to go down and we are strongly calling for that. </p>
<p>It is absolutely clear that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go up or down. </p>
<p>Some are arguing that a part of it is due to <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia on top of inflation expectations that would justify the fact that we remain a little bit below 2% for the sole inflation expectations. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-01-13</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>Now, this is technically quite complex, because you can interpret this break-even as incorporating inflation expectations and <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia on future inflation. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that when things are said that are, in my opinion, important and excellent, why not mention them? </p>
<p>As regards what the United States <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not ask, we will see when we participate in the meeting, but again, I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> in any respect what we will do, or what the British Presidency will do, I will only say that the present global consensus -- and it has been expressed several times before now -- is that we all have homework to do. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that for myself only a few days ago: one of the member countries of the Eurosystem issued securities on a thirty-two-year basis -- more than thirty years -- at an extraordinarily low level of interest rates. </p>
<p>If they did not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in this capacity, they would elevate the level of their inflationary expectations and we would immediately have medium - and long-term market interest rates that would be higher, or much higher, or much, much higher. </p>
<p>And if you want to know what it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be like, you only have to look at what existed before the euro was set up. </p>
<p>And that is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> only if markets, if investors, if savers, <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in the capacity of the ECB to deliver a very low level of inflation over thirty-two years. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the strong expression of vigilance has played a role in calming down something that was rising slightly. </p>
<p>And that was really something which I praised because I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it was something important. </p>
<p>That being said, of course they <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuate</span>, and our successive analyses are very much based on what we are observing on the side of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Together, we signalled to the market that we would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> sell gold under a certain ceiling over a period of five years. </p>
<p>We can, of course, within the framework of this accord, where we have internal arrangements, have one participant deciding not to use his option, in which case there is, of course, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for the option to be utilised by others. </p>
<p>But we all agree that one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at the global level in the economy is the constellation of imbalances. </p>
<p>So it is much more the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for arranging the timing. </p>
<p>As you know well, what you observe in Germany in the real estate market is not what you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> observe in other countries such as Spain or anywhere else in Europe. </p>
<p>On the first point I would say, that we are very eager ourselves to have the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> exchange of views between the Eurogroup and the ECB. </p>
<p>Our will has never been to have a Eurogroup which is as weak as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- it is exactly the contrary. </p>
<p>We all have our responsibility, but it is important that we understand each other as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> with mutual respect and mutual respect for independence, which goes without saying. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> mention at least three G7 communiqués on that. </p>
<p>At this stage our monetary analysis <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> strongly that we have a high level of liquidity, higher than would be necessary for the appropriate financing of growth in Europe. </p>
<p>We are reasoning in the medium term in this respect, not in the short term, and it is part of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have clearly identified. </p>
<p>So that is a question that we have to follow carefully and without undue alarm, but it is part of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we are identifying. </p>
<p>I note that the market has, thanks to this accord a full understanding of the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> interaction between the central banks and the gold market, as far as the signatories are concerned. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-02-03</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>I do not want to pre-empt the result in any respect, but the principles I have mentioned are very strong, which calls, of course, for as thorough as deep and strict as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> an examination of what has happened. </p>
<p>Each institution must <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> its responsibility. </p>
<p>In the euro area -- and it is the euro area as a whole that we have to look at -- we have signs that credit dynamism, <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> foster asset price increases in the real estate sector. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the remark you were alluding to is part of this overall sentiment. </p>
<p>I do not want to be alarmist, but I must say that we have, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, a rather low appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> by markets at the European and global level. </p>
<p>But there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> materialise, and we have to be vigilant. </p>
<p>On the contrary, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that by being vigilant and credible on price stability, we are preserving a financial environment that is, as you know, extremely favourable in our view. </p>
<p>It is nothing alarming that we <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have such a phenomenon. </p>
<p>I would say that it is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> also the G10 's sentiment that we are currently observing quite a low level of spreads and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in financial markets and, in some cases a certain under-pricing of some <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And, as you know, when we extract the inflationary expectations from index bonds, we see -- <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on our analysis -- that we are at levels which call for vigilance even if they allow very low long-term rates. </p>
<p>On top of that, of course, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have the spreads I have mentioned, the different assessments of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are generally quite low at a global level. </p>
<p>And it is there that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have the under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> I mentioned. </p>
<p>We have <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> absolutely nothing at this stage. </p>
<p>Had we not had the Stability and Growth Pact, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been said that we were putting the cart before the horse, because we were very bold in introducing a single currency without having a federal budget. </p>
<p>Then you have all the spreads corresponding to the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the quality of the various signatures. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that the explanation we had on the portfolio shifts and then the unwinding of portfolio shifts, which was a convincing element in understanding what was happening, does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> now in our own analysis to be convincing in explaining the present dynamism of M3. </p>
<p>But we expect that there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> again be ups and downs over the coming months. </p>
<p>I mentioned the figures for the last month, and we expect the figures for this month to be lower, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> significantly lower. </p>
<p>We also insist -- although it was n't mentioned in the question -- on the fact that the monetary analysis calls for vigilance, as I said, because we see dynamism of M3 and dynamism, by definition, of the counterparts of M3 which means that we -- from that standpoint -- can see that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have an overhang of liquidity. </p>
<p>We should be conscious of the fact that there is <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>As you know, headline inflation <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> arithmetically very much on shocks, in particular to the evolution of oil prices. </p>
<p>Any proposals that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> emerge from the EU Council will certainly be examined very carefully by us, with the idea that we can improve things. </p>
<p>And I will certainly not mention anything in advance of our meeting other than say what we have already conveyed to the Chinese and they know exactly our sentiment on a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> better functioning of the global economy, if some moves were to be made. </p>
<p>As I have already said, there is no contradiction between price stability and the best environment <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>We have observed a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-03-03</b>, 37 sentences</p></div><p>I here quoted Germany, but I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> quote the Netherlands as offering an opposite example, over the last few years, where you had a period of great success as regards cost competitiveness, then buoyancy in the economy and then increasing unit labour costs that were eroding this very remarkable" over-competitiveness ''. </p>
<p>And of course these are what they had extracted, at the moment of the computation of the projections, from their observations at the time and from futures, because these <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> are based on information enshrined in a futures market. </p>
<p>I only mention that in the staff projections, the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> for the annual average oil price for 2005 was USD 44.7 per barrel and for 2006 USD 42.2. </p>
<p>It is also true that we have observed a level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that has been considerable over time. </p>
<p>And we are pragmatic and keep as close to the facts and figures as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>There we of course have a downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> as regards growth, and this is something which is important to consider, i.e. that we are in a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> environment and of course there are also <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> as regards headline inflation. </p>
<p>We are looking at the situation, we are incorporating new data and new figures and when it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> necessary to guarantee -- which is our mandate, and which is the needle of our compass -- price stability in the medium and long run, then, we will do what is necessary. </p>
<p>So, there is an arithmetic carry-over that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> explain <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> two-thirds of the disappointing outcome of the new projections in comparison with that of the December projections. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> if the price of oil is above what I just said. </p>
<p>We must have a referee which will be totally reliable and which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say" These are the figures ''. </p>
<p>That being said, we are not calling for changes in the overall framework that exists today, and where the Treaty gives responsibility to national authorities, what we do is to call on those national authorities to engage in as close and intimate cooperation and coordination as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And it is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we are making that we would observe a smooth evolution in the context of long-term, global growth, which would call for additional reserve instruments or additional monetary and financial instruments. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is extremely important not to engage in permanent battles on figures. </p>
<p>As regards the advances towards a single market -- a real single market -- for financial services, we are as you know very much in favour of advancing in that direction as far as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I said already that it will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on the observations of the first quarter of this year. </p>
<p>We call in any case for an evolution that would be as smooth as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>There are both difficulties which are obvious and also elements which are <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more encouraging. </p>
<p>When you ask people all over Europe, they still have this idea that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> price stability will not be delivered. </p>
<p>So it is clear that we are looking at what is happening and taking into account the facts and figures and data to the extent that they are available and <span class='uncertainty'>reassessing</span> the situation along the lines that I have just said. </p>
<p>We will see exactly what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> happen. </p>
<p>We expect, but again we are <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, that this phenomenon will continue and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> accelerate in line with what I have said and, in particular, with the earnings, improved earnings, and improved profitability of a number of private institutions in the private sector. </p>
<p>But you know that behind all this stands a theory quite sophisticated, because you have the inflationary expectations themselves, and then you have <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia for the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> inflation <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and also liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia. </p>
<p>According to available figures, and we have to remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent, we have seen growth in capital investment which is not negligible for three quarters: 0.5% in the second quarter of 2004, 0.6% in the third and 0.6% in the fourth. </p>
<p>In all continental economies, including the United States, it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for some states to be booming while others have a much lower level of growth. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain why Germany, whilst making a lot of progress in its cost competitiveness position, is still registering unsatisfactory domestic demand. </p>
<p>My second observation, and I will not expand too much on this, is that, as you know, in the case of Germany, a correction is made for the number of working days, which <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> plays an important role. </p>
<p>Again, I remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>What we have observed, if I take private consumption growth in the euro area, and -- again -- <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on a very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> checking of the figures, is that we had quite robust growth of private consumption at the very beginning of last year. </p>
<p>I remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>I take for likely, I do not recall exactly, that it was a comment on the last observations of the last quarter of last year and there, again, we have to remain a little bit <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> on how to interpret what has been observed, in particular in Germany. </p>
<p>A small part <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, or a bigger part -- it has to be checked, it is very delicate -- of this insufficient level of consumer confidence can come from the fear of inflation in the future. </p>
<p>And if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> only add one element: we are there to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also have the reverse phenomenon: The phenomenon where you are accumulating a very low level of unit labour cost and then after a long period of accumulation, of" over-competitiveness '' you are losing this" over-competitiveness ''. </p>
<p>There are reasons to think that this is the sign that private consumption <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> in the future be more robust than we observed in the second and third quarters of last year. </p>
<p>You can call this what you like, but I would say that these are projections that are <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downwards. </p>
<p>That is <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> by all observers, by all market literature and by all market futures observations, and observers <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me in line with the reality of our own posture. </p>
<p>So we have to be again <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, look at the various data, know that it is normal to have and to observe differences. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-04-07</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>I also think that it is important for consumers to be as good energy savers as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, I would only say that I am making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the Constitution will be approved. </p>
<p>There are a number of other elements which are incorporated in the bond market evolution including a number of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be very low in the present period for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>We would also say that, if the IMF embarked upon gold sales, it would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be better, from the IMF 's standpoint, to use them to reinforce its own position -- its financial position -- rather than to finance debt relief. </p>
<p>Let me also mention that in the present international environment we observe none of the intra-European <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> that there would have been with the various national currencies before the euro. </p>
<p>Again, we are making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we will progressively see this moderate ongoing growth develop, but we are very pragmatic. </p>
<p>I myself signed the G7 communiqué calling for the oil market to function better and to improve transparency, and I will reiterate that goal: as high a level of responsibility as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> from all partners concerned, whether they are producers or consumers. </p>
<p>On top of that, there are other conditions for growth and job creation and that do not <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on us. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, in the perception of observers and market participants. </p>
<p>So I would be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> -- and more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> than you are -- in making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that what you can extract directly from the present bond market signals the fact that they incorporate depressed long-term growth. </p>
<p>I think it is our duty to be as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> on that. </p>
<p>We would have had a lot of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, a lot of difficulties, and not only on the exchange rate side, between the various European currencies, but also on the interest rate side, with a piling-up of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia, <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in the interest rate market. </p>
<p>This is the reason why I mentioned that in the months to come we would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> observe a level above 2%. </p>
<p>I would also mention that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see one of the producers had decided to produce as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> without any other limit than its own capacity. </p>
<p>First of all, as I said today, reiterating what we said in real time -- and it is very important for me to stress that -- on 21 March, it is imperative that Member States, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union implement the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> framework in a rigorous and consistent manner conducive to prudent fiscal policies. </p>
<p>I would add that, if -- despite the thoughts I am expressing, which are certainly shared by a number of partners and shareholders of the IMF and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even large shareholders -- a decision were taken, then it would be absolutely essential that it should not upset the market. </p>
<p>As you know, we only provide ranges ourselves, capturing also the concept of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> as regards what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen. </p>
<p>There are different legal arrangements from country to country: in some countries the decision is left to the Executive, whereas in other countries the decision is shared by the central bank and the Executive ; still in others, the decision <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be left entirely to the central bank. </p>
<p>In terms of our own position, we would certainly be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> in this respect. </p>
<p>I will only say that, as far as the euro is concerned, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that there is a tendency to forget the situation before the euro. </p>
<p>And I would also tell the European households who are hesitating -- and a number of them are reluctant to consume because they fear future <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> price <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> -- I would tell them" No, we are here to ensure that you have price stability and you have your purchasing power protected. </p>
<p>Regarding <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> sales of gold by the IMF, this is indeed an issue that is discussed in the IMF. </p>
<p>Of course, the benefit of good decision is that those kinds of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and difficulties are eliminated, but you then forget the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and the difficulties. </p>
<p>First of all, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> know, we are a signatory to the Central Banks ' Gold Agreement that was published on 8 March 2004 following discussions by a number of central banks. </p>
<p>Again, the only working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> I am making is that the Constitution will be approved and ratified. </p>
<p>I have to mention that because I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is something that is important. </p>
<p>That said, it is a theoretical <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>And this is the reason why I mentioned earlier that before the euro we had a number of difficulties, drawbacks and very important <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we had to cope with. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-05-04</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are still there. </p>
<p>We are all taking extremely seriously the presence of these six currencies in ERM II and we will continue to carry out our actions together with the newcomers as responsibly and professionally and efficiently as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to prepare, when the time comes, when convergence has been achieved and when criteria have been met, for what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the next step. </p>
<p>There is no contradiction at all between being faithful to our mandate and preserving an environment as favourable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>As regards our own understanding, I would not have any kind of conclusion in the direction you are presently <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span>, i.e. that we should <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> down the 4.5% target. </p>
<p>I do n't exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that in the latest review of growth potential for various European economies and for the euro area as a whole, for the European Union as a whole, we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> discover that the consensus of economists goes in the direction of <span class='uncertainty'>revising</span> down previous estimates. </p>
<p>You also have the introduction of the idea that you have a medium-term growth potential and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a longer-term growth potential. </p>
<p>This is my own working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> and, again, this would be in line with the idea of having an integrated financial market and financial services market at the level of Europe as a whole. </p>
<p>Because, if economic agents think that the delivery of price stability will be 1.9%, it is because they <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we will be vigilant. </p>
<p>As far as our own staff are concerned, you also know that, since we first embarked on the publication of these projections, they have produced quite large bands to capture the degree of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>And as regards my own position, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that last time, and even two months ago, I said in response to a question like yours that" I am not optimistic, I am not pessimistic, I am realistic ''. </p>
<p>But as I have said already, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> on the occasion of the last two or three press conferences, it is not -- at this stage -- alarming at the level of the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>Those higher inflationary expectations, as augmented, would be incorporated in market rates, and then this" good advice '' would lead to a result which would be exactly the contrary of the result which is hoped for, I <span class='uncertainty'>presume</span>. </p>
<p>For the last point, the question was already asked: we firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our mandate calls for maintaining interest rates where they are and that if we were to go in the direction which is from time to time <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> we would not get a decrease in rates. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that price stability and the present environment, which we are helping to create on the financial side, are elements of confidence for the households. </p>
<p>We undertook a very thorough analysis of the situation and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the interest rates are in line with what is required by our overall economic and monetary analysis. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-06-02</b>, 36 sentences</p></div><p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that by being very clear in the eyes of public opinion, households and market participants that we were vigilant, we have permitted precisely those inflationary expectations to remain firmly anchored. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also have quoted Mr Johnson and the chief economist of the OECD. </p>
<p>And if we moved interest rates, either down or up, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase medium - and long-term market rates, not decrease them. </p>
<p>I am not telling you anything that would be interpreted as <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> we are preparing a rate cut. </p>
<p>If you compute the standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> as regards inflation you have 0.9% on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>
<p>Observe the market <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we have in front of us. </p>
<p>Everybody sees that we do all we can by being faithful to our mandate to have an environment which would be as favourable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to growth. </p>
<p>As regards the yield curve, of course, market interest rates <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the global appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and also on the global supply and demand of capital, which influences real interest rates. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> I am told, we are told with my colleagues in the Governing Council:" Look, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you should be a little less demanding on price stability. </p>
<p>As regards examples of various central banks having had good experiences and bad experiences, I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that you consult the academic literature, which is very abundant. </p>
<p>Nobody would have <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span>. </p>
<p>And on top, this increase of 100 basis points we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have an additional <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium. </p>
<p>Again, I have to say very firmly that when we look at the dispersion of growth, for instance, or the dispersion of inflation in this vast continental economy which is called the euro area, with 306 million people, and we compare that with a vast continental economy which is called the United States of America, with a little less than 306 million inhabitants, there are figures which can be computed in terms of standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> for growth and for inflation. </p>
<p>And if your question were to be whether or not there is a <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> for California, Alaska or Florida to have their own currencies, I would do exactly the same. </p>
<p>Because it was really something which <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> extraordinarily difficult to achieve. </p>
<p>So you have to have an insurance premium against the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of seeing further increases in the definition of price stability. </p>
<p>So, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly improve in this respect in comparison with the United States, but it would be unfair to say that we have only defects on this side of the Atlantic and that there are only assets and qualities on the other side. </p>
<p>What we are very proud of is that -- that <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us - solidly anchor had been at our level and therefore authorises a lower level of market interest rates. </p>
<p>We also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that improving confidence, particularly in the consumer constituency and in the household constituency in general, would be a very important means to foster growth and job creation. </p>
<p>I do not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that any of these institutions or individuals do not do their job. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in what we do and we are observed not just by all of you, but by the entire world. </p>
<p>If I take the year-on-year standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> in Europe on the basis of the first quarter of 2005, I have a figure of 1.2%, which is the lowest level since 1999. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> interpret what has been observed here and there as precisely part of the difficulty of this pedagogic challenge, this communication challenge which is a challenge for governments, parliaments, opinion leaders in general and also for this institution. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we can prove that success in the economic and arithmetic studies that we carry out. </p>
<p>Again, I do not draw from that a definitive conclusion, but I want you to know this, to have these figures and to see the extent to which there is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> from time to time an over-amplification of issues. </p>
<p>We know that we have important responsibilities and we know that with a great level of responsibility comes <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> criticism, <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> observations of any sort. </p>
<p>And everybody knows that if we had to do something to guard against inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we would do it. </p>
<p>I think that it is clear that as far as structural reforms -- reforms in general -- are concerned, we all have to explain as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, to convince the people of Europe that everybody would be better off with the reforms. </p>
<p>And then it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have an impact which would be negative in comparison with the present monetary and financial environment, which again, as far the financial environment is concerned, is exceptionally favourable to growth and to job creation. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> in this room we also have editorialists that are very keen on advising us to increase rated and even <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> think that we should have increased rates for quite a period of time. </p>
<p>An environment which we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is optimal under the present circumstances. </p>
<p>I am telling them: <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it is time to invest. </p>
<p>As regards the evolution over time, we do not observe change in this standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> figure. </p>
<p>If you have the intention to embark on an increase in consumption and you are still hesitating because you have some lack of confidence, you can do it -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it is time to consume. </p>
<p>They still have some <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we will really deliver price stability. </p>
<p>At least, if it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us, we will do everything necessary to ensure price stability. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-07-07</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>In a number of economies and countries the sentiment of the people is even that there are more price increases than we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, more than is calculated at the national or European levels. </p>
<p>The influence of an increase of oil prices goes in the two directions you have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>. </p>
<p>Now, let me say the following: any kind of comments from my side about a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> change of our own mandate is totally out of the question. </p>
<p>And from time to time advice going in both directions in the same media, as is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> normal in the very vivid opinion-based democracies of Europe and the world. </p>
<p>And again, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we are doing all we can by preserving price stability, to deliver a financial environment which is good for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>Reflecting not on a short-term basis but on a slightly longer-term basis, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that growth will be more dynamic. </p>
<p>So I do not know whether others were more efficient in delivering a financial environment which would be more favourable for growth and job creation, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we are trying at least to do our best and we have elements that would substantiate that we are doing everything we can to be credible in delivering price stability. </p>
<p>Things <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be different tomorrow. </p>
<p>We considered all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> factors that are guiding our own judgement on the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>That being said, we also say -- and I have said this before -- that we have real downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the three reasons I have been mentioning: oil price increases, which are of course something that is certainly important, global imbalances, and the level of confidence. </p>
<p>We are not in a normal situation in this respect and, as you know, the international community -- and the ECB as member of the international community -- <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> that progress can be made and must be made in the functioning of the market, particularly as regards higher levels of transparency of that market, so I would take advantage of your question to call again for as much transparency and responsibility as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> by all partners. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> anywhere that we are and will remain faithful to our mandate. </p>
<p>But, simultaneously, I would call on all partners to be as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, for the producers to be as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, as well as the consumers. </p>
<p>I am not sure that you will find any other place in the world where such <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> are offered ! </p>
<p>We were not in exactly the same environment in terms of oil prices, with all the effects that oil prices have on both growth and <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future inflation. </p>
<p>So observers, market participants and economists <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that because of these successive shocks, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have inflation over and above 2%, but nevertheless they had and they have full confidence in our capacity to deliver, in the medium run, price stability. </p>
<p>I have the honour of being invited every month, together with the Vice-President, to the meeting of the Eurogroup, so this makes three times a month that we have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of a physical encounter. </p>
<p>In the case of 9/11 it <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> that, because of the difficulty with some counterparties on one side of the Atlantic, we had to be -- in the United States as well as here -- very attentive to the necessary pouring of liquidity. </p>
<p>As regards inflation, it is absolutely clear that we have to take into account the administered prices and administrative decisions that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> influence the inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> on the upside. </p>
<p>We will exert it as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the organisation of the executive branches, I see very favourably the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> organisation of the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>We judge the pros and cons of all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> action. </p>
<p>On the first point I would say that we do not think at this stage that these events <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have any significant impact. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>So we have a joint interest in this convergence exercise being as successful as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and as well checked as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But again an increase in the price of oil has exactly the two consequences you said, it is exerting downward pressure on the growth side and it is adding to upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the inflation side. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-09-01</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>We have exactly the same judgement as we had before, but since then, downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth have <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span>, and these are undoubtedly associated with oil prices in particular, but not only oil prices, as I just said, also commodity prices in general. </p>
<p>As you know, being credible <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our own action to preserve inflation in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>So all I can say is that, as you know, we already consider Bulgaria and Romania as friends, as observers in our committees and meetings, including those of the General Council, so as to prepare in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for their belonging to the European Union, and tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, if criteria are met and if everything is in good order, to the euro area. </p>
<p>But there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and of course the oil price increases are one of the obvious <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth. </p>
<p>Nobody knows what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> happen in the near future. </p>
<p>And everything <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on what we call the second-round effects. </p>
<p>We are, in the Governing Council, saddened by the terrible events in the United States and that are proving again that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> can materialise in all domains in a terrible fashion. </p>
<p>On the first point, I have to tell you that the Governing Council of the ECB is pursuing its own responsibility as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are committed to it because it is required by European law and also because, in our opinion, it is good for the economy of the euro area, for the European Union and for the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> functioning of the level playing field in this sector. </p>
<p>And you can see clearly that the staff of the ECB, have <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> our growth projections slightly down for this year and down also for next year. </p>
<p>And we have to remain particularly vigilant as regards <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> second-round effects. </p>
<p>We have also <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> upwards our inflation projections. </p>
<p>That being said, whatever the national arrangement, we are strongly in favour of the closest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> cooperation and coordination between banking supervisors. </p>
<p>This is the reason why, even in the present circumstances, with undoubtedly a big difference between the previous projections and the present projections, and taking into account all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have mentioned, it is nevertheless our opinion that there is today no case for increasing rates. </p>
<p>Because, undoubtedly, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have been augmented, not only by the price of oil but also by the increase in the price of oil commodities. </p>
<p>And I would underline that it is the responsibility of China, it is the responsibility of the Central Bank of China, it is the responsibility of the Chinese authorities to take decisions in this respect, and that, in any case, seen from an objective standpoint it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the facts, the figures, the overall international and Chinese environments, as well as those of other countries, <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that it would be in the interests of all to continue the move in the same direction. </p>
<p>You deduce yourself what we will or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do. </p>
<p>In our opinion, and because you all know that and the market knows that, the market <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> we are credible and capable of delivering price stability. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-10-06</b>, 36 sentences</p></div><p>But, as I said clearly, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for us are on the upside, and it is absolutely clear that we have reinforced the message of vigilance. </p>
<p>And this is a little bit different from the previous language, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, in the previous Governing Council meeting. </p>
<p>As regards Mr Fazio, I will only mention that we have taken a decision regarding the draft legislation and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> comment on that if I have a question on the draft legislation. </p>
<p>I know that the European Commission, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> know yourself, is also examining the situation. </p>
<p>We consider that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are on the upside. </p>
<p>First, the Governing Council welcomes the draft article, which provides that the Governor will have a fixed term of office of seven years, without the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of renewal. </p>
<p>But, again, we consider that strong vigilance is appropriate because we are now clearly facing upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Third, once the draft article have been fully implemented the state will be the majority -- and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> the sole -- shareholder. </p>
<p>Second, there is an institution that is entitled to decide on such matters, and the relevant institution in this matter is Eurostat, which <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the European Commission. </p>
<p>Second -- again it is a question which has to be checked, examined in detail and decided upon by Eurostat, which <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the Commission itself. </p>
<p>We are, in principle, against one-off operations because we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they do not help at all. </p>
<p>As a general rule, the ECB does not like one-off operations because we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that then there is a problem: you have it good for one year and it 's not good for the following year. </p>
<p>On the second point I will only say that our position is crystal clear: we really think that implementing structural reforms all over the euro area will make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to elevate the level of the growth potential of the euro area, and this elevation of the growth potential is necessary if we want to have, again, more growth and more job creation. </p>
<p>In the Governing Council we consider all of these 311 million people, just as the Federal Reserve in the United States takes simultaneous account of Massachusetts, Florida, Alaska and California, all of which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have very different situations, as they historically have had. </p>
<p>We look at the average for the whole of the euro area, so I would say that, as an average, and despite the fact that in Germany the figures are very depressed, we nevertheless have figures that are on the high side, and that is one of the reasons why we have to consider upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and have to be strongly vigilant. </p>
<p>Of course, because of these levels -- the nominal levels, as I have already said -- we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there is an absolute need to be strongly vigilant as regards precisely these second-round effects, which can be much more lasting and are our worst enemies. </p>
<p>As regards the inflationary expectations, we have to remain very prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, but until now the surveys have been confirming their correct anchoring. </p>
<p>On the question on whether or not we discussed it -- we discussed clearly the situation and we envisaged advantages and inconveniences associated with the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take. </p>
<p>And I would say that in some cases yes, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be good to have nominal wages and salaries moving more slowly than the labour productivity increases. </p>
<p>I will not, because it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on a number of parameters, give you any figures now, but it will go higher -- that is absolutely clear -- in the months to come. </p>
<p>Second, it is the Governing Council 's opinion that a fixed term of office should also apply to the other members of the Banca d'Italia 's Directorate -LRB- the" Direttorio '' -RRB-, comprising the Director General and two Deputy Directors General, since they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be involved in the performance of ESCB-related tasks. </p>
<p>Over the past two weeks you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have seen that we have observed rates on ten-year government bonds in some countries of the euro area as low as 3%. </p>
<p>And we concluded that the present rates were still appropriate, that upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability were augmenting, and that we were in a posture of strong vigilance. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have seen, as we have, some surveys that are encouraging, but we have to remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>If growth materialises, of course it will be an element that is part of our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, but I remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>Because, again, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this is our mandate, and because this would then immediately disanchor inflationary expectations. </p>
<p>On the first question, I have already responded several times, so again: everybody knows that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> move rates at any time. </p>
<p>I said that, taking all things into account, we had some signs that our own staff working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> was materialising. </p>
<p>If it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that these positive elements are materialising, then they will be part of our overall analysis and it is clear that it will be incorporated in the overall perspective for price stability in the time to come. </p>
<p>When we thought about creating the euro, nobody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have imagined that 311 million people in the euro area would have had access to such low 10-year market rates. </p>
<p>The reason we have such low rates is in particular because we are credible, as far as price stability is concerned, over the next ten years ; and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say also over the next 30 years, or even the next 50 years ! </p>
<p>In the light of the changes to the shareholders ' composition, the election procedure for the members of the Board of Directors -LRB- the" Consiglio Superiore '' -RRB- should be clarified and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> simplified. </p>
<p>When Bulgaria has entered the European Union, then the first question which will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be asked of the ECB will be whether or not it is opportune to enter the exchange rate mechanism, and I can not respond in advance, so I can only confirm what I said. </p>
<p>One is to recognise that the flexibility within the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> superior to what some had envisaged before the euro area was set up, meaning that there can be some important moves up or down in the relative cost competitiveness of the various economies. </p>
<p>The pros and cons of a rate cut <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been envisaged by some, yes. </p>
<p>But we do consider that all the elements that we have are indicating that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are on the upside. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-11-03</b>, 45 sentences</p></div><p>So, if you need some other information <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> communicate to me what your assessment is of what the market is doing. </p>
<p>They are very much deciding after reading your excellent articles, because they <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on the information they have and the overall environment including, of course, your own communication. </p>
<p>It would be even much better if you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do it in a very effective and active way. </p>
<p>We have undoubtedly another <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which I have to mention which is protectionism. </p>
<p>We see very low spreads, we see very low <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and this is of course an element which has to be looked at carefully because it is not necessarily sustainable over the long run. </p>
<p>There is a last element which I have to mention which has been mentioned by the financial stability forum as a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, which is the under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the global economy at the present moment, at least till now where we see very low real interest rates. </p>
<p>But so far there is nothing to contradict the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>So, in our own judgement there is no contradiction between being faithful to our mandate and supplying Europe what it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> need in terms of growth and job creation. </p>
<p>Because global prosperity <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on the absence of protectionism and the least that I can say is that we are looking here and there and we see some emergence of this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, which is extremely unfortunate. </p>
<p>A disappointing first semester and a second semester, which would be more in line with this <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a pick-up in economic activity. </p>
<p>So I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we were instrumental in moving a bit the state of the art in this respect. </p>
<p>I still remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>As regards the monetary aggregates ; as regards the components of the monetary aggregates, including M1, which is very dynamic ; as regards the counterparts of monetary aggregates, including loans to the private sector, which are very dynamic ; as regards our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a second semester, which would demonstrate a certain pick-up in economic activity. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have some indications that were obviously less flattering on the consumption side. </p>
<p>It is clear that the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> I have mentioned, which is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of the staff of the ECB, is also the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of all international institutions. </p>
<p>We consider the monetary pillar as being very important for us, particularly as we had to organise the transition to the euro in a fashion which was extraordinarily ambitious, because we had to ensure that the euro had the highest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> level of credibility. </p>
<p>Strong vigilance is of the essence in our eyes and we clearly see increased <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>We try to do as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, thanks to you also, in terms of being transparent and communicating in a world which is complex. </p>
<p>We are very keen on having the closest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> harmonisation and cooperation between the various authorities concerned. </p>
<p>We have a number of indications that confirm this working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, including various surveys, industry PMI, service PMI. </p>
<p>Again, as regards the national law in question, we consider that it allows for a degree of discretion that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in a manner which is not in line with the principles to which we are attached. </p>
<p>I am exactly in the" mood '' of Athens with the additional message that everything we have observed since then has confirmed the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> we made in Athens, both in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are increasing and in terms of a pick-up in activity. </p>
<p>So, all I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say, is that at a global level there is very large consensus and we are part of this consensus which considers that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are at stake are the oil price, which is a very important <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>To your first question, it 's absolutely clear that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we handled these difficult circumstances very well. </p>
<p>And my last point is the following: Without prejudice to the outcome of the current proceedings in Italy, as a result of its informal dialogue, the Governing Council has come to the conclusion that the procedures followed in the context of the recent cross-border takeover bids concerning Italian banks were based on a national legal framework that allows for a degree of discretion that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in a manner which is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives of the Community. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> observe during the last months a certain tendency to go up. </p>
<p>From that standpoint we are looking at all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> information, particularly the break-even inflation. </p>
<p>We also agree that we have to correct them in the most resolute way <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>You know that our present action, according to the mainstream academic research, would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> start having real influence over a period of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 18 months, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> two years, and will continue to have influence over a longer period of time. </p>
<p>We, the Governing Council, have a position: we say clearly that - as you mention yourself - under the national legal framework there is a degree of discretion that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in a manner that is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives. </p>
<p>M3 dynamism is indeed very closely associated with loan dynamism as a counterpart and that is one of the main reasons why we consider the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability to be clearly on the upside. </p>
<p>And we have particular difficult - as you know - because the futures market for instance is not a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the position of the Governing Council on the Italian case, I am not speaking of the position of any particular Member of the Governing Council, including a few that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have expressed themselves. </p>
<p>We mentioned the modification of the current draft to allow for collegiality, which would be desirable, and without prejudice to the outcome of the current proceedings in Italy, as a result of its informal dialogue the Governing Council has come to the conclusion that the procedures followed in the context of the recent cross-border take-over bids concerning Italian banks were based on a national legal framework that allows for a degree of discretion that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in a manner that is not necessarily in line with the above-mentioned principles and objectives of the Community to which the Governing Council is attached. </p>
<p>Second, we had a very nice discussion, again, weighing the pros and the cons which were associated with the two <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> I already mentioned, and we came to a consensus. </p>
<p>It is also, from that standpoint, absolutely clear that we have to look permanently at the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and particularly the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, of inflation. </p>
<p>The problem, on the contrary, if you want to solidly anchor inflation expectations -- particularly in the medium and long term -- is that you have to be able to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span>. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> unavoidable that some sentences have been tougher than others and so forth. </p>
<p>First question: Yes, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the 2% level that has been maintained for a substantial period of time has been the right response by the ECB to the various situations in which we found ourselves. </p>
<p>Today, and as I said in Athens -- and we referred explicitly to the Athens judgement and assessment - we think that present interest rates are still appropriate, that strong vigilance is of the essence in the present situation and that inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside. </p>
<p>Everything we have seen since Athens has confirmed the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> we made there. </p>
<p>Everything that we have seen since then has confirmed that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> was well-founded. </p>
<p>If there were only one or two I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> specify those two countries. </p>
<p>We were called on to say and to promise the market that we would not move for a" considerable period of time '' -- you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that -- by a variety of economists, by a variety of good advisers. </p>
<p>We will never -- and I trust that no central bank would -- wait for the materialisation of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to act. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2005-12-01</b>, 44 sentences</p></div><p>So, here we are doing something that we consider to be exactly appropriate to cope with those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to avoid a materialisation of those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>From time to time, I am told that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> do not actually materialise. </p>
<p>But if a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> materialises, it is no longer a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> ! </p>
<p>As regards your first question to the extent that the short-term market rates had already <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> our today 's move this move was incorporated in the Eurosystem staff projections. </p>
<p>Among those people who are looking at what we are doing and taking decisions on a day-by-day -- even a minute-by-minute -- basis, you have non-euro area residents holding <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> EUR 3.5 trillion in negotiable instruments and liquid deposits. </p>
<p>So, where monetary policy is at stake, there is absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span>. </p>
<p>In English it would be -- it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me --" ex ante ''. </p>
<p>It is perfectly <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that 2.25 has the same characteristics ! </p>
<p>But I will tell you -- because you are offering me the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of making the point -- that what we do is to cope with the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we see. </p>
<p>There are cases where core inflation is a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>And the market people -- the specialists observing what we were doing, looking at our website -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that there was no change. </p>
<p>On a shorter-term basis, namely for next year for instance, there is also quite a large sentiment -- but, again, I am very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> -- that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> we are just below 2%. </p>
<p>When I take the analysis of the OECD, the IMF, the Commission, our own analysis, the private-sector analysis and so forth, I would say, as regards the medium and long-term growth potential, that the previous appreciation was that it was between 2% and 2.5%, and now there is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a sentiment -- again, I am <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> as you see -- that we are closer to 2%: 2% plus something which is meagre, 2.1%, 2.2% <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> ; but closer to 2% than 2.5%. </p>
<p>And I will refer to what <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me to be some kind of emerging consensus. </p>
<p>We will look at the facts and figures, make our judgement on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability and take the decisions we will judge appropriate to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>However, there are a lot of cases where core inflation is not a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>... no, I am not sure it is an increase in <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> It is an implementation of <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span>. </p>
<p>And then the extent to which there would be a specific impact in a given country <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on a variety of other factors that influence economic activity in that country as well. </p>
<p>It would apply rather to the much longer term -- 20 or 25 years -- taking into account very poor evolution of demography and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> also the very negative working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that structural reforms are not being done. </p>
<p>Collegial wisdom implies that you exchange all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> information, arguments and analyses. </p>
<p>We discussed all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> arguments and exchanged views to be sure that we were taking the best decision. </p>
<p>And, as I have said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with regard to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that we had indicated that we were in a mode of strong vigilance in Athens and I remember that all of you noted that the sentiment of the Governing Council was different in Athens in comparison with what it had been a month before. </p>
<p>We try to be as transparent and predictable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>If you eliminate all those prices that are pushed up and maintain in your understanding of inflation those which are pushed down, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it is not fair ; <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it is better for demand-driven change in relative prices to look at the full picture and not only at part of the picture. </p>
<p>Today we have judged unanimously that the increased level of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability embedded in the situation were such that today 's correction was necessary to fulfil our mandate and to maintain the full credibility that we have. </p>
<p>And then it is added that one should wait for the materialisation of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Some <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have imagined that we would have gone higher, and others <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> would have thought before the discussion that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> wait a little longer. </p>
<p>On <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span>, we were very proud to be one of the most predictable central banks of the world, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say" ex aequo '' with a great sister institution -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the most predictable -- and we will continue to be highly predictable. </p>
<p>It is therefore very misleading to trust that core inflation -LRB- of which there are various definitions -RRB- is always a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>Second, as regards the banking conference in Frankfurt which took place <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> a fortnight ago, I did not stand up, I was there at the banking conference, I had been invited, I was on the spot, and the Chairman of the panel, Mr Walter, asked me" <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you tell us, Sir, what we need to know and to understand on interest rates and the monetary policy of the ECB ''. </p>
<p>Again, before the euro was set up nobody was <span class='uncertainty'>predicting</span> that we would be as credible as the most credible central banks. </p>
<p>Who would have thought that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> stand here in front of you and tell you that over the past five years we have had the same level of medium and long-term market rates -- not to speak of the short-term rates -LRB- we are lower as regards the short-term rates -RRB- -- as the best and most credible currencies. </p>
<p>We confirmed the view that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were on the upside and had augmented at the press conference and in the introductory remarks a month ago, and that was again noted by everybody. </p>
<p>An additional remark we made was that there is now little <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that a large part of what we are observing in the oil prices and in the commodity prices is a demand-driven process, that is, coming largely, but not exclusively, from emerging Asia and is also producing a lot of consequences in the manufacturing sector. </p>
<p>We will monitor all developments closely, as I have said, with respect to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>At that time, there were so many voices speaking on interest rates, not inside the Governing Council but outside of it, that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> some of you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have had trouble understanding exactly what was happening, and I thought that it was appropriate to provide this information. </p>
<p>If I am not misled -- but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I was reading things too rapidly -- they were divided: ten on one side and eight on the other side. </p>
<p>I have said, as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, what we thought and what our own understanding of the situation was. </p>
<p>In the introductory remark, we mentioned the fact that, from time to time, we hear voices mentioning that core inflation -- that is, their definition of core inflation -- is the best <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span> of future inflation. </p>
<p>Because it was <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> we do this or that. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span>, what I am telling you now is an emerging consensus amongst our own constituency of central banks. </p>
<p>Because of our remarkable own credibility we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> deliver this extraordinary low level of rates, which had been the privilege of only a part of Europe and not the privilege of 311 million people. </p>
<p>We judged that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability were increasing, were on the upside, and I made that very clear in responding to questions. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-01-12</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>From that standpoint, I confirm that, from our own perspective, the message has been well-received and interpreted, including as regards what is presently in the market for <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future decisions. </p>
<p>We will monitor very closely all developments with respect to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the medium term. </p>
<p>I would not embark on any kind of" gossip '' in answering the part of your question which relates to how we should act in view of <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> stemming from a slowing down of the global or US economy. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in the mind of any market participant, observer, investor and saver that we will act and do what is necessary when it is necessary. </p>
<p>On the two first points there is clearly a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which we take note of. </p>
<p>It is always time to be as sound and reasonable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in terms of protecting real wages. </p>
<p>So I do not want to comment on one particular prior indication that the fourth quarter in one particular country <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been different from what was expected. </p>
<p>I add that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> each of us has his or her own way to mention the fact that we will monitor all developments very closely. </p>
<p>We will see again what the present state of the economy is, whether our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is confirmed. </p>
<p>Until now, everything that we have seen has confirmed our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> on the progressively more favourable conjuncture. </p>
<p>We are presently at a level which some are saying is a bit lower than what they had in mind and then it will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> go upward only for the arithmetical reason that it will incorporate the most recent upward move. </p>
<p>Taking into account both so-called soft figures -- surveys, polls -- and hard figures, I would say that the bulk of information received since our last meeting confirms our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>As regards our discussion: as always, each one of us is weighing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Second, I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth existed and that they were on the downside. </p>
<p>Our credibility <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on everyone knowing that we do not hesitate to act when necessary, and we have demonstrated that recently. </p>
<p>We, of course, remain pragmatic -- we <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on facts and figures that we examine very carefully, as always. </p>
<p>As regards the imbalances, we consider that they are a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to global growth and, of course, to economic growth in Europe too. </p>
<p>We were very proud because, as you know, it was a unanimous decision of the Governing Council of the ECB which made it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to get out of a situation which was obviously very difficult. </p>
<p>On the sentiment of the Governing Council, I will only repeat what I have already said: we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the medium term and take the decisions that will be necessary. </p>
<p>As regards the economic situation, we will see whether the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> continues to be confirmed. </p>
<p>Those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have fortunately not materialised ; but they exist, and that is the reason why we gave this message. </p>
<p>But because there have been downward moves in the price of oil recently followed by upward moves, we expect the profile to be <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>So, if you look at the price of oil, which is obviously very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>, and then make projections using these different levels of the price of oil over a short to medium-term horizon, of course you find different levels of inflation. </p>
<p>It is clear that if the economy develops and continues to be at a level of growth which is significant, then it augments the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that I have mentioned. </p>
<p>All the information we have received since December has confirmed our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>Second, all the information at our disposal since our decision of the beginning of December confirmed our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we were progressively reaching a rate of growth in the euro area that was close to potential, at potential or around potential. </p>
<p>I myself recently expressed the same sentiment on behalf of the G10 at the global economy meeting in Basel: that it was one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we had to take into account when analysing and listing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to global growth and to growth in each particular component of the global economy. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-02-02</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, I explicitly mentioned the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth and the international <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are there and should not be forgotten. </p>
<p>In reply to the first question, in the introductory remark I mentioned that there was a certain degree of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> from quarter to quarter. </p>
<p>Second point: again, we consider that when we take a decision, be it a decision to increase rates or leave rates unchanged or whatever, we are confident that it is what is needed at the time we take the decision in order to continue to cope appropriately with the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>On the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- and there I am not on the external, but on the domestic, side of the coin -- I would say that since Q2 and Q3 of last year we have observed something materialising which had been expected for quite a period of time, namely the pick-up in investment. </p>
<p>Let 's also be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about that distinction between soft and hard. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also have mentioned, of course, a lot of information which were much more encouraging, including a number of surveys from all over Europe, not only this country in particular. </p>
<p>Looking at all the information we have and taking into account our baseline scenario that <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> has been broadly confirmed by all what we have observed. </p>
<p>I would say that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> on growth has been broadly confirmed by all what we have observed. </p>
<p>And, as we have always said, and as my predecessor always said, we incorporate all pertinent information to see what the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are and what the appropriate response is in order to cope with those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I would say, to the extent that we see the development of this ongoing economic expansion, we see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> progressively augmenting </p>
<p>Second, as regards the market expectations for future action in a short period of time -- what I am observing <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be reasonable. </p>
<p>So I am looking forward to our continued cooperation ; and, of course, within the Eurosystem, the Banca d'Italia is a very important member of the team, and we will continue to maintain the closest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> relationship with this institution, in line with the team spirit which characterises the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> interpretation, because, as you know, another major central bank had embarked upon such a concept. </p>
<p>We thought, taking into account the trend of the baseline scenario and taking into account the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, according to our analysis of their presence and their dynamics, that it was the right decision not to move this time whilst, at the same time, clearly, we have increased vigilance and I also commented on what is presently expected by markets. </p>
<p>But we think that it was exactly what we had to do and there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>And I think that your colleagues have no <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about what I have said. </p>
<p>We want to be as comprehensive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the economic analysis. </p>
<p>We also have the issue of labour productivity progress that is lower <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> precisely because the single market has not been achieved in this domain. </p>
<p>All I would say is that, from the information I would extract from stock market -- over the period of time you have in mind -- what I call our baseline scenario <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be confirmed and certainly not negated. </p>
<p>You have a hard figure at a certain point in time, then one month later it is reviewed and <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> and it goes up or down, and then two months later it is again <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> up or down. </p>
<p>First of all, Arcelor and Mittal Steel are not in the services sector, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so we will not discuss that at all. </p>
<p>I do n't of course rule out the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> decide at that time, but there is certainly no rule and it has to be very clear. </p>
<p>Oil prices are on top of the list of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- certainly in the eyes of this institution, and also in the eyes of all others -- and there is also the issue of imbalances. </p>
<p>These are the two major <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have been mentioning. </p>
<p>To the extent that what is at stake is the position of the ECB itself and if there is any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> on the ECB position, yes, you got it perfectly right. </p>
<p>I will not comment in any other fashion on what we in the Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do. </p>
<p>Second, as always, we have weighed thoroughly the assets and liabilities associated with various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>, and we did that as thoroughly as usual. </p>
<p>I was very happy to congratulate him when he was nominated and then appointed, and I am sure that we will continue to have the closest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> relationship on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>
<p>That being said, I have added today that what I see as regards the very short-term expectations of future moves <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be reasonable, taking into account all the information I have. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth, I have mentioned that it is on the external side that we see the major <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-03-02</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>There are two messages: first we did not decide today ex ante on a series of monthly increases, as other central banks <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have done ; at the same time, we stand ready to do whatever is necessary and appropriate to ensure price stability and anchor inflationary expectations and to continue to contribute, through that anchoring of inflationary expectations, to a favourable financial environment. </p>
<p>Again it is a working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we will have a significant contribution to growth coming through that channel. </p>
<p>Same thing, it is not a reason for us to change our present assessment, certainly not to change the projections which have just been made, but we will see whether beyond the inevitable <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of these figures there is something more permanent. </p>
<p>On the first point, we weighed the assets and liabilities, the pros and cons, associated with various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>: zero increase, 25 basis points and 50 basis points. </p>
<p>We will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>As regards the future, we will decide to move on the basis of the facts, figures and data, and on our future assessment of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Our aim is to be as certain as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, with the best analysis <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, that we are at any given moment in time putting our monetary policy stance in line with what we feel the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are for future inflation. </p>
<p>You can draw any conclusion from past observations, of course, but I have always said that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> act whenever needed. </p>
<p>And again, we will what will be necessary in the future <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the data, facts and figures. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that when you look at the immediate, real-time estimate of the output gap, and then you look at the same analysis of the output gap one year afterwards, or two years afterwards, you see such huge differences that you have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We will see how the situation develops and whether the new assessments of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability lead us to take new decisions. </p>
<p>Today 's decision is in our opinion the right decision in line with our present analysis and our assessment of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>I fully understand that a number of observers and economists would look at it, but we are very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> in this respect. </p>
<p>I told you that we will continue to monitor closely all developments that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> modify our assessment of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>They are not necessarily fully satisfied with the present level of inflation, as <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> in a lot of surveys, and they are calling upon us to meet our responsibilities, which are given to us by the Treaty. </p>
<p>At the same time, we have <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> not yet seen the following hard data confirming the soft data. </p>
<p>What is absolutely clear is that in our analysis, which is shared by economists and observers particularly in international institutions, after having had a clear driving force coming from the external side, then having seen <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> since the middle of last year, an important contribution to growth coming from investment and gross capital formation, it would be in line with the normal sequencing to have now a significant contribution coming from consumption. </p>
<p>In the case of Spain it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we are observing today a certain appeasement vis-à-vis the previous evolution. </p>
<p>As I said, we are very pragmatic, we <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the information that we receive and we will examine all new information as it comes in each month or each quarter. </p>
<p>As regards the reason why we increase rates today, it reflects our assessment of all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we see. </p>
<p>We are reasoning over the medium term and we have to be sure that we are countering these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>This monetary analysis gives information which we consider pertinent and which is also pointing in the direction of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability in a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer term perspective. </p>
<p>You mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that our own assessment of future inflation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be lower. </p>
<p>I have mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability coming from the delay in incorporating in non oil prices the previous oil prices increases. </p>
<p>We are doing it to counter these inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>But some German figures are clearly a good sign, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>It is clearly one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have to be fully aware of. </p>
<p>The economic evolution is for us pertinent to the extent that it modifies the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>We consider monetary analysis to be important under our two pillar strategy not only because it permits us to cross-check the economic analysis but also because it gives us particular information on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> from the medium to the longer-term horizons. </p>
<p>That is just to give you an order of magnitude and the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> to make a comparison. </p>
<p>First of all, as I say very often, we look at trends and it is absolutely normal that we have had a good deal of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the day-to-day figures concerning soft data and hard data. </p>
<p>It is a stimulative monetary policy -- there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-04-06</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>I would say that the current suggestions regarding the high <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of an increase of rates in our next meeting do not correspond to the present sentiment of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>From time to time, we give information that is a little bit different from what the market <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have expected. </p>
<p>You were mentioning downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth in a number of countries. </p>
<p>It 's true that quarterly growth <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> to be a little less flattering than was expected for the fourth quarter but we look at the trend. </p>
<p>I trust that, for the sake of clarity, transparency and simplicity, it was <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> useful to make these two remarks. </p>
<p>We make a synthesis out of all information received and we are not impressed by short-term or quarterly <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have asked a question on rumours about markets, exchange rates, etc. -- we never comment on rumours. </p>
<p>As regards the first point, I would say that it is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> normal behaviour to consider the last indication that you have received as a very important indication. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> clear to me that it was a good way to look at the situation and that all the information we have had since then has confirmed that we have a trend which is around our growth potential. </p>
<p>I remember when I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> do something in December. </p>
<p>In the present case, it is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a slight correction, because the market, if I am not misled, is pricing in a 100% <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that in June at the latest we will move rates. </p>
<p>It is our responsibility to be as clear and transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> with market participants, investors and savers. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> draw your own conclusions, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that I was very clear on both May and June. </p>
<p>They would represent a high <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but one which did not materialise. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember we were a little bit challenged after our last monetary policy meeting. </p>
<p>Inside the euro area, or the de facto euro area, you have very good examples that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be benchmarked: you have Ireland, which has no mass unemployment. </p>
<p>I would say that the Governing Council considers that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> as regards growth are really balanced at the moment I am speaking. </p>
<p>We increased rates, while we said: yes, there is some <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> as regards quarterly growth. </p>
<p>I would only say that we are in a process of normalisation, we are in the process of countering inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have seen as being on the upside for some time. </p>
<p>It is one of these concepts on which, of course, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see a lot of different analysis and a lot of different opinions. </p>
<p>We see these imbalances as a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to growth and, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, we see two major <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth: the price of oil and global imbalances. </p>
<p>On our side of the Atlantic, it 's clear that structural reforms are absolutely of the essence and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> contribute not only to being better off in Europe but also to a better situation at a global level. </p>
<p>In the present particular case, even if the Governing Council did not discuss that, I would say that it does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me in line with what would be appropriate. </p>
<p>As regards the discussion on accommodation or neutral rates and so forth, I would only say that what we have always been doing is to counter inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>But taking the euro area as a whole, we really <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what is in the financing laws for 2006, does not correspond to the optimum in a period of cyclical recovery, even if we had some good news as regards the 2005 final results. </p>
<p>I guess that the reaction of some people <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been the result of being impressed by some very good figures that we had for Germany. </p>
<p>We look at the trend, we are not impressed by the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of figures, whether they are so-called soft data or hard data. </p>
<p>The reasoning <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> go" Bad fourth quarter last year, ahah, they will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> cool down their interest rate increases ; good news, of course they will accelerate. '' </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even say there are a number of indications which are really on the upside. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go back to only one month ago when some of your colleagues would have questioned increasing rates at the moment where you see that euro area growth in the last quarter of 2005 was only 0.3%, which is much lower than the growth potential or trend rates. </p>
<p>We are not too impressed by <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-05-04</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>At the global level, it is not particularly the sentiment of the Governing Council of the ECB, it is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> rather the sentiment at the level of the G10 and of the global economy meeting that we regularly have in Basel - which I have the privilege of chairing - that progressively the very powerful dampening that you mentioned on global inflation stemming from globalisation itself, and the increase of the share in the global economy coming from very low unit labour cost economy, that this is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> gradually diminishing. </p>
<p>I had the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of expressing the view of the ECB in the IMFC meeting, so I respond to your question, it has been the case as we had called for. </p>
<p>Again our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that broadly our present assessment will be confirmed. </p>
<p>Everything that we do is <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> upon our own analysis based upon as robust as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> information, analysis, data, facts and figures, as I always say. </p>
<p>I used the word several times, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> three times if you counted well. </p>
<p>It would have been the biggest mistake we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have made. </p>
<p>I already responded on the way we look at this if our main scenario develops, as we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it will. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the other major institutions also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it will. </p>
<p>Let me remind you, that at some time in the past I heard analysts and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even some media <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that we should wait for the second-round effects to materialise before increasing rates. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go back to our analysis in December and at the beginning of this year, because you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that we had not that good data in some respects. </p>
<p>That is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we always mention. </p>
<p>A <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> would be that further increases <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be made. </p>
<p>As regards the economic analysis, we have confirmation that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, our main scenario, is pertinent and with growth growing faster than before, it pushes up <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>As regards the most important <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, it 's the constant position of the Governing Council that the most important <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> would be second-round effects. </p>
<p>These will be our contribution, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a modest one, because we are not largely imbalanced, as you know. </p>
<p>Again, I remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>Second, I have always mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to growth that we have to be aware of. </p>
<p>This was also my response to your third question: I do not see these second-round <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> materialising at the present moment, including in wage and salary formation, but we have to remain vigilant. </p>
<p>I would even be bold enough to say that, when I participated in the various" Gs '', including the G7 in Washington, I had the sentiment that all parties concerned were speaking for real when they said that they would do their best to implement what I call their" homework '', all partners including us, even if our contribution <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not be very large. </p>
<p>This is one of the elements that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> argue in favour of a change in the overall behaviour of some of the consumers. </p>
<p>As I have said already to the extent that our scenario is confirmed, it is clear that further withdrawals of monetary accommodation will be warranted, and there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>No, I think that this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has not augmented. </p>
<p>As regards the inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> we consider that this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is going upwards and that is why we said vigilance is of the essence. </p>
<p>We of course have to prevent this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> from materialising. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that you always got me right in the press conference. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also confirm to you that the Eurosystem has regular meetings with our Latin American friends --. </p>
<p>All what I can say at the moment I am speaking - again I remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> - by making the synthesis of all the information we have been receiving -- information on growth, information on oil price increases, information on exchange rates, all kinds of information -- is that it broadly confirms our baseline scenario, but I will not confirm anything that would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that our growth projection would be different from the present baseline scenario to the extent that you addressed explicitly the question of growth. </p>
<p>And, in the case of the national economy, i.e. the largest economy in the euro area that you have mentioned, it is clear that the main drivers of growth are -- at the moment, but that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> change and I trust that it will change -- exports, net exports, and investment. </p>
<p>I would say that as orderly and smooth evolutions as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> are certainly welcome in this respect. </p>
<p>But I will not comment on any bold moves that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been decided. </p>
<p>We synthesise our understanding of what is happening, we examine various models of the economy and of the behaviour of the euro area economy to have as robust analysis as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and then we make up our mind on the basis of all this information. </p>
<p>It is a very professional exercise and I do not want to prejudge in any respect what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be produced. </p>
<p>I would be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> - as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> understand - on the projections. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-06-08</b>, 49 sentences</p></div><p>I think the dynamism of the credit reflects to some extent the dynamism of the economy and I think it would be appropriate to have a little bit of a slowing but again, it is a question of each bank deciding and taking the measures necessary to ensure that they can handle the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that they are taking. </p>
<p>Our decision certainly does not <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> mechanistically on any particular input, including the input from the projections, which are an important piece of information for us. </p>
<p>Regarding your first question about credit, what a central bank does and what we have been trying to do is to signal very clearly the need for banks to measure properly the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> involved in lending. </p>
<p>We see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen, but it is not our central scenario. </p>
<p>On the future trajectory of our interest rates, we are working on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we will proceed with a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation ; not unconditionally, but <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on the confirmation of facts and data, and on the basis of our own future observations. </p>
<p>We do not <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on any single piece of information or any single model of the economy. </p>
<p>So what we have been asking for is prudence, measuring properly the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, taking into account properly the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and in that sense I think we have achieved a lot. </p>
<p>Of course, you can refer to this as a tightening of monetary policy, but I like to use the expression" withdrawing monetary accommodation '' to refer to what we will do or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do according to the confirmation of our baseline scenario. </p>
<p>We want to be as comprehensive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are always <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> and we are always free to do what we judge to be appropriate. </p>
<p>We always at any time do what we judge to be appropriate for countering the existing inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and ensuring price stability over the medium run and for continuing to anchor solidly inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>One important issue is how the counterparties of the hedge funds, i.e. banks and businesses, can assess <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are associated with the products that are being offered, as well as with the hedge funds as institutions. </p>
<p>Hedge funds are, by definition, institutions that are in the business of taking and diversifying <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>In the Financial Stability Review, we focused on <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with the operations of hedge funds. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say a word on that, Lucas. </p>
<p>I invite, on behalf of the Governing Council, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner to each meeting of the Governing Council, i.e. twice a month, which allows as much contact as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that repeating the mistakes of the past would be terrible because as we know, those mistakes had an enormous cost and were extraordinarily difficult to cope with. </p>
<p>We have signalled several times that this poses <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but at the same time, we have also expressed that, in addition to the increasing debt, there has been an increase in the wealth of households, which is a positive development, and that the central scenario is still that this over-valuation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be corrected smoothly and not necessarily through an abrupt correction. </p>
<p>Full completion of the single market is a target which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us extraordinarily important, not only because it is one of the major goals of Europe as a whole, but because it would considerably improve the functioning of the European economy. </p>
<p>In terms of the evaluation, we have <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> expressed that when you look at fundamentals, the present evaluation was above these fundamentals. </p>
<p>And we observed that <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> had augmented in a large number of markets. </p>
<p>Of course, one important issue is that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management systems are further improved, and they have improved a lot in recent years. </p>
<p>First, the question on <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>I think it is remarkable and I will take this opportunity to mention that it is something really exceptional in the world, but not <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> in Europe. </p>
<p>In a way we are responsible for the level of the sea, but some swimmers, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, can swim above that level other ones below. </p>
<p>That being said I would also draw your attention to an argument which I see from time to time and which does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me to be appropriate. </p>
<p>Again, if this pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were to increase <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, it would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be going in the direction of an improved pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>When I look at the projections, the changes in the growth projections for next year, which have been <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> slightly downwards, are fully in line with other projections, for instance the Commission projection. </p>
<p>As I have always said, we think that our interest rates are correct and correspond to what is needed to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>That view which is shared at a global level by the constituency of central bankers - I say that as Chairman of the G10 -, which thinks that there has, to a certain extent, been an underpricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the global financial markets. </p>
<p>In a sense, this is going towards a more" normal '' situation as regards growth and, it calls for countering increased inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to progressively withdraw monetary accommodation. </p>
<p>The Vice-President and I have a special responsibility for that team spirit to be as good and deep as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>: we issue the currency and I sign the banknotes. </p>
<p>We also have the oil price <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have now come to know rather well over a very long period of time, and I would say, in that respect, any event that occurs in the geopolitical sphere obviously has an influence. </p>
<p>This is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>We judged these increases to be the best and most appropriate way of dealing with the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we had analysed. </p>
<p>In my understanding, the relationship that the ECB has with the executive branches, in line with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the best organised at the global level. </p>
<p>So, I would say that anything we have that goes in the direction of an alleviation of this combined <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of oil prices, commodity prices and geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> would go in a good direction, but I have no other comment. </p>
<p>That being said, we also looked at the fact that it came after a long period of very low <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, something which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be regarded, according to some analysis, as a normal correctional phenomenon. </p>
<p>And they have played an important role in the diversification of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and in contributing to the efficiency of the financial system. </p>
<p>If our <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> and scenario -- our baseline scenario -- are progressively confirmed, and until now we have been very happy to see that it has been confirmed, then the progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation would be warranted. </p>
<p>And the main driving parameter has been the change in the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> about oil prices. </p>
<p>In a way, the re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the financial markets also corresponds to a view of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>I would draw your attention to the following: the level of inflation, which is closely correlated with the unit labour cost and the costs in general in the economy, functions in such a way that what one particular firm would theoretically gain out of a theoretical abstract computation of real interest rates is much more than offset by a loss in terms of cost competitiveness: what is lost when inflation is above the average is much greater than what you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> theoretically gain with a lower level of real rates. </p>
<p>When we list the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at a European and global level, I would say that we have the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, we have the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of protectionism, we have the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are associated with a disorderly evolution of the global financial markets, given the underpricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have already alluded to. </p>
<p>But as far as the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> about long-term rates are concerned, we - in taking a long-term rate <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> - took the yield curve foreseen by the market. </p>
<p>This was the judgement of the Governing Council as regards the level of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have to counter at the moment and it was in line with what -- to my understanding - the market itself was appreciating. </p>
<p>In our opinion, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability augmented sufficiently during the preceding period to trigger our interest rate increase in last December, a new interest rate increase in March, and the new interest rate increase today. </p>
<p>Therefore, the change that we introduced is not as big as suspected by some, and consequently, I would not underline any significant change in the projections that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be attributed to that change. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-07-06</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>That being said, we will continue to monitor all information very closely and to be as pertinent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in our economic analysis and our cross-checking with the monetary analysis. </p>
<p>But we proved in Madrid that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase rates also outside of Frankfurt. </p>
<p>One can interpret what has happened as some kind of repricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>: that would go in the direction that we had more or less <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> because we were not that happy with the previous very low level of assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And I think it is the right way of looking at what we have been doing in the past and at what we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do in the future, based on our own analysis and judgement of the facts and figures. </p>
<p>This is very important and we consider that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside. </p>
<p>It is also clear that we had already diagnosed a degree of underpricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the financial markets in general, observed in particular as regards spreads, as regards <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> premia. </p>
<p>I have no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>-LRB- <span class='uncertainty'>May</span> the best team win ! -RRB- </p>
<p>You know that all our decisions are <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on facts and on figures and I have said this sufficiently frequently for you to be fully aware of this. </p>
<p>However, we have a lot of teleconferences in the course of the year, something of which you are <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> not fully aware, and decisions are always <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> via teleconference. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> announcement that we meet by teleconference is usually made the Friday before the meeting, but next time we will in fact meet physically. </p>
<p>Why are you raising rates when <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> are being expressed in market literature? </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that we increased rates against a lot of recommendations. </p>
<p>We ourselves hope that Poland will go as far as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in this direction. </p>
<p>I would therefore repeat that it is exactly the contrary of what your question was implicitly <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span>. </p>
<p>Until now, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, these have been quite well understood. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is in the interests of Poland taking into account the Treaty and the fact that the euro area is open to Poland, as well as to all other friends, provided they meet the Maastricht criteria, provided they have converged sufficiently, and taking into account the fact that they have no opt-out clause, which we are happy about. </p>
<p>So," progressively '' meaning to the extent that we see our baseline scenario developing according to our own projections and scenario, then we will progressively withdraw monetary accommodation in order to permanently keep inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> under control. </p>
<p>On financial market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> we have looked at this phenomenon. </p>
<p>It is clear that there will be some kind of boom-bust profile, which would be normal and is <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> by all institutions and observers. </p>
<p>On the first question, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that I have already responded. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-08-03</b>, 38 sentences</p></div><p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on what we do. </p>
<p>Others <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we are in-between 2% and 2.5%, but <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> much closer to 2% than to 2.5%. </p>
<p>And again, I will not underwrite any figures, but I would say that if you said in the present situation that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 2% <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be an order of magnitude it would not necessarily be absurd. </p>
<p>We consider that it is one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have constantly mentioned. </p>
<p>But I can mention a number of studies which <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that, for the euro area as a whole, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be at the level of 1.9%. </p>
<p>I can only confirm to you that, if our scenario and our <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> are confirmed, there will be a progressive alleviation of the monetary accommodation that exists today. </p>
<p>I have always myself said that we <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the confirmation of our baseline scenario, on facts and figures. </p>
<p>If our baseline scenario is confirmed, if our <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> are confirmed, then we will progressively withdraw monetary accommodation. </p>
<p>Of course, we will have new projections, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> expect. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be -- I do not exclude that at all -- surprised by the dynamism of the domestic economy of the euro area. </p>
<p>Now, we will do what is necessary, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on facts and figures and new events. </p>
<p>This is the reason why we are calling for structural reforms, because we firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is the lack of structural reforms particularly in a period of very rapid changes in science, technology, and globalisation, that explains why we have a disappointing level of increase of labour productivity. </p>
<p>We have our baseline scenario and we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have a lot of new events -- price of oil, geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, also good surprises that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have in the rest of the world. </p>
<p>You know that we consider that fiscal consolidation -- at the present level of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and dangers that exist in the various economies of the euro area today -- is improving the confidence of entrepreneurs, the confidence of economic agents in general and the confidence of households. </p>
<p>We have to make the best out of this wealth of information, but it is clear that there are areas where we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have good surprises. </p>
<p>I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that hard figures are the only reliable figures or that survey figures are the only reliable figures. </p>
<p>Again, even if I said that our own sentiment for growth was balanced on a short-term basis, it means that we have downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the one hand, but we have also upside chances on the other hand. </p>
<p>We will do all what we judge appropriate, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> again on the wealth of information that we have, coming from our own analysis and the very impressive wealth of information and analysis from public and private institutions. </p>
<p>But we will see what happens, and again, we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>The decisions we took since December as well as the fact that the market is <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> our decisions, and that the yield curve is showing an upward trend, all this has played a role. </p>
<p>On the first point, I mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we saw to prices and I mentioned a number of those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- such as the increase in the price of oil -- which we have observed in the past, unfortunately, I have to say, and which are still a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>As I said, we <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> permanently on new information. </p>
<p>So, you will have all <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> to compare statistics of the highest quality on a state of the art professional basis. </p>
<p>There is also the point which you have mentioned, which we consider ourselves to be very important and which has to be examined very carefully, namely what we call a stronger than currently <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> pass-through of past oil prices and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> add of past commodity prices. </p>
<p>As regards our assessment of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability and to growth I have told you clearly that we saw the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the short, medium and long term to be on the upside. </p>
<p>As regards our own decision, it was not <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you have noticed that we said that we will be, when next year starts, in a euro area with 13 economies instead of 12 sharing a common destiny with a single currency. </p>
<p>It is also the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of the social partners. </p>
<p>We consider the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth to be balanced, on a short to medium-term basis, and to be on the downside over the longer term. </p>
<p>I mentioned additional increases in prices -- I am not mentioning past increases that have already been decided and fully incorporated in our own projections, but rather the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future increases in administrative prices and indirect taxes -- and I mentioned the traditional -- in this press conference -- second-round effects, in particular wages and salaries increases. </p>
<p>We have a mandate, we are faithful to our mandate and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is the best way to help growth to be sustainable and job creation which, very fortunately, is now visible, sustainable in the medium and long run. </p>
<p>On a longer-term horizon, we see a number of downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>On the particular impact of geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, I do not see, at this very moment that these have contributed in any significant fashion to hampering growth. </p>
<p>I would say that on a short to medium-term basis, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth are in our opinion balanced. </p>
<p>This is particularly the case as regards the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I mentioned. </p>
<p>I also mentioned the fact that we live in a world where <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, and indeed great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, is unavoidable. </p>
<p>But it is clearly a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that has to be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>On the fiscal side, I would only say that we have always told our interlocutors, the Commission and the executive branches, that in delivering the appropriate fiscal position required by the Stability and Growth Pact, in an overwhelming majority of cases, to be as sound and reasonable as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> on the expenditure side is the first best option. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-08-31</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>But we have been using this word for quite some time now, and it is the first time this question is asked, so I take it for granted that <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> everybody has understood what it means. </p>
<p>Therefore I would say that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the oil and commodity markets is really something which is absolutely of the essence. </p>
<p>To sum up what I have in mind as a synthesis of all information of a large array of analyses, I would say that today I mean over the last five years or even the last ten years -- the level of <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> a yearly increase of labour productivity is half the level we had in the euro area in the 1980s and half the level observed since 1996 or 2000 in the United States. </p>
<p>You can see what conclusions we draw from the changes in our own assessment of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>As regards the IMF meetings in Singapore, the Eurosystem and the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we must have an appropriate presence which corresponds to our responsibility. </p>
<p>And if we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> benefit from the same gross labour productivity progress as is observed in the United States we would have a growth potential again more than 1% higher than the present one. </p>
<p>On the first point, in view of the shocks that we have had to cope with, we can understand -- and I said that today also -- why for instance a large part of the new projections as regards inflation are explainable by the fact that <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> on oil prices and commodity prices have changed. </p>
<p>Also as regards the exante levels of savings and investment in the world economy, on top of all that has been said already, on the level of savings in Asia and in the emerging economies in general and also on the behaviour of corporate businesses in the industrialised world -- which is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, in terms of investment, at least until now more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent than before -- we have the oil element ; and the oil element not only triggers consequences as regards the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> but also simultaneously produces a level of additional" forced savings '' in a world which is far superior to what we had observed before. </p>
<p>And this of course is an element which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to explain why financial markets are under the influence of this very abundant supply of additional savings. </p>
<p>The speed limit itself has to be elevated and that is why we always mention structural reforms as being of the essence Thanks to our own mandate of price stability and to the extent that we deliver price stability, we have a very important responsibility in permitting growth to be as close as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to the speed limit and not to be <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> ; in avoiding the stops and goes that are associated with inflation. </p>
<p>The upward move of the ranges is very clearly associated with these dangers and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Of course, this has to be considered with a significant element of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>I mentioned the imbalances and the price of oil and other commodities, and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also mention geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<p>And I am not sure that it is exactly appropriate in the present period: first of all we have a number of other indicators that are also supposed to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> future episodes in the cycle and they are not at all giving the same indications. </p>
<p>As regards our overall <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> and those of our ECB staff, it is what comes out of the future market because that is the only objective way you can look at it. </p>
<p>But I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that there are a number of economists who are concentrating only on the <span class='uncertainty'>predictive</span> capacity over the cycle of the slope of the yield curve. </p>
<p>As regards the methodological <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, as you know for exchange rates the Eurosystem staff is photographing the situation of the exchange rate at the given deadline ; and then go along the period and that would call for 1.28 in the present <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> that are underlying the projections. </p>
<p>That being said, we are in a universe of significant <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, and the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> slowing down of the US economy does of course have an impact on us. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> because observers, economists, and market participants understand this so well that we have succeeded until now in anchoring inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that the materialisation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with further increases of oil prices that we mentioned earlier is now being observed and this is crystallised in these projections. </p>
<p>As regards the international environment, I said myself that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> had augmented, and I would say that we are in a universe which is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> more <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> than before. </p>
<p>I will not comment more on that as it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we are clear enough. </p>
<p>Our concept is very simple: we do what - in our opinion - is necessary to counter the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we see, to deliver price stability over the medium term and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. </p>
<p>I have underlined the phrase" progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation '', and what has happened in the past <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to provide all the appropriate keys to understanding how we act. </p>
<p>But we have a number of other <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<p>You have <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, what I would call quarterly <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of data, including GDP, which is major information. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact when we increased rates in December you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that we did not have good news, because we had the immediate data relating to the last month of last year, which were not good. </p>
<p>I know that, for instance in German, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> in Dutch or in other languages, it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> mean an augmentation of the size of each decision, but it is not that meaning that we have in mind, it is the regular English meaning. </p>
<p>That needle of our own compass, which is our mandate, is extremely important because it permits us to be as close as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to the speed limit of growth in the medium to long-run perspective and to diminish the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of output. </p>
<p>As regards inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, they are on the upside, and this is a sentiment which we also see fully confirmed by the information we have received. </p>
<p>I would say that <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> it is bad, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> it is very good. </p>
<p>But I would not qualify the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of realisation ; and, to my knowledge, nobody does that, because, if I speak the language of economists and mathematicians, I would say that there is clearly an element of Knightian <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in what can happen to this domain. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-10-05</b>, 50 sentences</p></div><p>The sequence for M3 in the most recent period of time, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> recall, was 8.8% in May, 8.5% in June, 7.8% in July and now 8.2% in August. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> recall that we were in an environment in which a large number of analysts including international institutions and a significant proportion of the market literature were signalling that, according to their economic analysis, we were not fully justified to increase rates. </p>
<p>So, you have a high level of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> appetite in all of the financial markets, and that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> appetite <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> wo n't last forever either. </p>
<p>At this stage, all that I can say is that, according to all information I have, in 2007 it would be <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> as an average over and above 2%, but there is of course a great influence from various parameters, including the price of oil as regards headline inflation next year. </p>
<p>I am convinced -- and we are all convinced -- that there are important <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and that is why we have to be vigilant as regards market <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We pay very close attention to those expectations and, as I have said, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us that these inflation expectations, on the basis of the indicators that we have at the moment, <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be correctly anchored In my view it is because nobody <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> our determination, given the fact that we have proven that we intend to be inflexible in fulfilling our mandate. </p>
<p>But on the other hand, you have an activity which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be more buoyant and that of course entails <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>I need also to mention and I do that from time to time, in terms of trade the UK is more important for us than the US, and that of course <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> a little bit paradoxical taking the size of the two economies concerned but it is what the figures are telling us. </p>
<p>As regards housing in the US and the US economy as a whole, you know that an order of magnitude which would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be considered by economists as a good order of magnitude would be that the trade coupling, plus the" echo '', the reverberation of the US economy on the rest of the world, which impacts also indirectly on the euro area would <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be summed up by the fact that if the US economy slows down by 1%, more or less, we have ourselves an impact on our growth, taking everything into account, of minus 0.2%. </p>
<p>On your first question, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you were n't listening to the translation or <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you were listening to English directly. </p>
<p>It represents a transformation, which of course from time to time encounters real difficulties ; and as you know we are doing all that we can to pave the way for the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> outcome. </p>
<p>I know that there are a number of schools of thought that <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the US will continue to be going steadily, others are thinking that we are at the beginning of something which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be more ample. </p>
<p>We can not sit back and let these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> go by without reacting. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> very well be below 2 in one month 's time. </p>
<p>At the end of the year inflation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> very well be substantially over and above 2%, even without changing the present price of oil. </p>
<p>Then I tell you the contrary, I tell you that we have inflation which is low, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even lower, but then it will go up again and that for arithmetical reasons that everybody can check. </p>
<p>We said more fundamentally that, given the very favourable dynamism of real growth of the GDP which we have seen over the last few quarters and given the strong growth in the jobs market in Europe at the moment, wage and salary increases that would be higher than what expected at the moment - would pose serious <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>I do n't exclude that <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> at all ; we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even be lower, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>. </p>
<p>I also have to mention the great corporate dynamism, which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be due to two major phenomena: investment -- and one of the good pieces of news that we have at the level of the euro area is that growth over the last period, particularly in Q2 of this year but also beforehand, <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have been driven by gross capital formation. </p>
<p>In our last Financial Stability Review, we had stressed - Lucas Papademos will certainly remember that because he was the one who presented the report - the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with hedge funds and we even had a specific box in that report in order to explain to all the observers how we see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> posed by hedge funds. </p>
<p>Remember I said growth <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> were on the upside. </p>
<p>But that does not mean, obviously, that there are no <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and that those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are not of great importance. </p>
<p>We were determined to raise the rates because the information we were getting from the monetary analysis was signalling that there were <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the medium to longer term. </p>
<p>We decided to increase rates for the first time after a long period in December with the benefit of the hindsight the decision <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to have been fully justified. </p>
<p>So I would say that we have to look at it from all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> angles to be sure that our final judgement is well founded That is exactly the reverse of when the prices are going up. </p>
<p>But, in addition to everything that I have said, that is to say low real long-term interest rates in Europe and in the United States on the best signatures, you have an assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which, even after the corrections of May and June, remains at a low level. </p>
<p>And from that standpoint I think it 's a bit too early to conclude in which direction the overall addition of the two <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- one downward <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and one upside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- would go. </p>
<p>And those who are in Paris today <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also have a memory of that, and of all the declarations and analyses of the time. </p>
<p>Third we have also the permanent threats that are associated with the global <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> connected with the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and the market <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> which are embedded at a global level. </p>
<p>The best summing-up I can give from the Singapore meeting and the confrontation of various analyses is that we were experiencing an extraordinary period of very robust global growth, around 5% for the fourth consecutive year <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> in 07, so a very impressive episode of growth in ' 04, ' 05, ' 06, and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> ` 07. </p>
<p>And then we have what I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> call modest but favourable developments in terms of the anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be part of the explanation for the whole development. </p>
<p>When you try to understand what that means, you will see that we extract all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> information from the financial markets. </p>
<p>But I would not exclude either the fact that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> go upward again because, as I said, you have a number of phenomena that are due to the profile of the oil prices twelve months ago. </p>
<p>There will be short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>But you have also seen that enormous amounts of savings have been amassed, and are still being amassed by the oil-exporting countries, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> not exactly quite as fast today as they were, but the increase is still very considerable, and obviously that is an additional element, when you try to compare savings and investment at world level. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be other phenomena, on which we are also looking at, including market phenomena, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also explain what we are seeing at the moment. </p>
<p>That being said there is also short term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, which is again something we have pre-announced. </p>
<p>I hope very much that these downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> will not materialise. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> those of you who were in Frankfurt also have a memory of that. </p>
<p>And at the same time, the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> were also seen on the increase and so we have to take account of those two elements: Solid growth on the one hand, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> rising on the other hand. </p>
<p>My sentiment - and I am communicating the overall sentiment of the Governing Council - is that after a relatively short period of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> we will go back to more normal behaviour. </p>
<p>As regards the profile of HICP due to the VAT increase in one big economy in the euro area, clearly there we have, I would say, a mainstream analysis which is <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that we will have a hump in HICP, starting in January 2007 it is extraordinarily likely, arithmetically speaking, and there is also a <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of having more consumption in the last quarter of this year, and less consumption in the first quarter of next year. </p>
<p>Our colleagues -LRB- including from Romania and Bulgaria as observers -RRB- are represented in all our committees in the ESCB, and we consider it our duty to facilitate things in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> fashion. </p>
<p>It 's an order of magnitude, I say that with great caution, which means that there is an impact, but that impact is not necessarily too large, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on what happens in the United States. </p>
<p>That 's also clearly <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> by the situation. </p>
<p>We should not pay too much attention to the short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that would be induced by this phenomenon. </p>
<p>As I said, over the shorter-term, we have economic growth here in Europe, in the euro area, which, in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, is broadly balanced, and even <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a bit on the upside if I take the immediate influence of the lower price of oil to foster growth. </p>
<p>In the longer term, we continue to think that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth remain on the downside, for all the reasons I have already said, and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> add some other reasons, but the main reasons we see are first the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the price of oil and second the very important <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have confirmation of, that protectionist pressures are themselves materialising: it is something which is very adverse to growth at a global level and at the European level. </p>
<p>First of all, let me remind all of us: when we told observers, investors, savers, economists, market participants that we <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that we had to move rates upwards -- you certainly remember that -- we did that some time before we increased rates in December. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-11-02</b>, 42 sentences</p></div><p>I expect that at the end of the year and beginning of next year, when we have the figures for December, and then those for January, that we will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be at a substantially higher level, because we have those base effects, and a number of phenomena that create <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in this domain. </p>
<p>And that would be totally independent from the long medium-term <span class='uncertainty'>prediction</span> by the market of what is likely to happen in the economies concerned. </p>
<p>Our present working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that there will be a soft correction -- not a sharp and abrupt correction. </p>
<p>Let me explain: when you bring notes from one safe to another or from one vault to another, you have <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> a mechanism which impregnates the notes with red ink in order to prevent further use of the notes when they are stolen. </p>
<p>It is in the analysis of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we say that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have to cope with a pass-through which is stronger than previously expected. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> the paper in question was <span class='uncertainty'>confusing</span> the person with the difficulty of his job. </p>
<p>And that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain in particular why we have such a low level of long-term rates on both sides of the Atlantic and everywhere in the world. </p>
<p>I would certainly hope so, but I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> our own projections, so we will see what our own projections are. </p>
<p>But let me tell you first that to the extent that we are looking at fiscal issues, I would say that in practically all of the areas concerned, and in practically all countries, we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> say that we judge that further efforts should be made to diminish public expenditure. </p>
<p>And you remember we were criticised at the time: some were saying that we tightened much too early ; others were telling us that the last quarter of last year 's growth was not flattering -- which <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be slightly true: now, after revision, it is 0.4%, while at the time it was estimated at 0.3%, which was mediocre. </p>
<p>Again it is an <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, and I draw your attention to the fact that I say this with extreme caution, but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, after having being stolen, these notes, already impregnated with the first liquid, <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been attempted to be" cleaned '' by the robbers and that operation <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have weakened these notes. </p>
<p>As regards the second semester: as I said, we still expect robust growth -- less flattering than in the first semester, which was absolutely exceptional, but it would remain substantial growth, certainly around potential, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> hovering a little over potential. </p>
<p>The Bundesbank published at 12.30 p.m. today a communiqué which explains what the Bundesbank and the Eurosystem understands about what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have happened. </p>
<p>There are a number of <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> as to what happened exactly, and why these notes were plunged into an acid. </p>
<p>At the present time, I would say that we are making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that this slowdown would be a soft slowdown. </p>
<p>That being said, it is of course linked to the fact that our trade with the United States is less important than is frequently <span class='uncertainty'>assumed</span>. </p>
<p>Also to be taken into account is the fact that, at the global level, what we see is that the slowdown in the United States is partially or <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be partially offset by continuous robust growth in a large part of the rest of the world, which creates an overall environment which remains quite dynamic, seen from the euro area standpoint. </p>
<p>We know that we <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to have higher levels of public spending than others, and of course, in the present world of increasing competition and profound and very rapid changes, this does n't work in our favour. </p>
<p>We are not making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a hard landing. </p>
<p>It is a way of protecting notes against the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of being stolen. </p>
<p>As you know, we have the feeling that this can not last forever, and that the present accumulation of the very low level of real rates, the very low level of spreads, the very low level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium that we are observing, the underestimation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general -- will necessarily be corrected. </p>
<p>As regards the pass-through -- again, it is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>When you have such capital chasing investment, it creates an environment where capital is abundant, and pushes down the price of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in general. </p>
<p>It is clear that the latest indications we have of monetary developments have not confirmed what we had seen some months ago when, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember, M3 growth was starting to decline progressively. </p>
<p>Again, it 's a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- I hope very much that it will not materialise -- but it is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>Let me give you the exact figures: for the evolution of M3 growth, we had 8.5% in June, followed by 7.8% in July when we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that we had something which was <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> there was the start of a slowdown. </p>
<p>The conclusion that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> draw from the yield curve as it stands is much disputed. </p>
<p>And I would say that the majority of economists -- certainly on the other side of the Atlantic but also on this side of the Atlantic too -- would not say that the present slope of the yield curve means that there is a very high <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of recession. </p>
<p>It is considered that you have to introduce a large number of other elements to conclude, and I said myself that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> -- which is shared, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, by the mainstream analysis and certainly by our friends on the other side of the Atlantic, in the sister institution -- is that a soft slowdown is very likely. </p>
<p>Now you will ask me how it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that there are such very low levels of long-term interest rates. </p>
<p>Several times when our rates were at 2%, we were repeatedly asked" <span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you guarantee that there will not be any increases in your interest rates over a considerable period of time? '' </p>
<p>At this moment, I would say -- with some element of caution, because we will have the projections in December -- that the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of the level of the headline consumer price index, as an average, being above 2% this year is certain, and remains likely for next year, on the basis of all the information that I have at this moment. </p>
<p>The fact that we have mentioned VAT in Germany as influencing growth and also creating <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> associated with it was in the statement or in the questions and answers a number of times already in such press conferences. </p>
<p>And we had said" No, we will not tell you that we will not move in the months to come because we are alert and we will do whatever is necessary to cope with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and threats to price stability ''. </p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight you see that it worked very well: we happen to be very predictable ; and the market has understood - it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me -- pretty correctly what we had in mind. </p>
<p>On the components, we nevertheless see the influence of our monetary policy tightening, because M1, as you know, is now <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> less dynamic. </p>
<p>As you know, there is a mainstream analysis that <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that we will have a hump in the last quarter of this year and then the bust after the hump. </p>
<p>Further administered price increases are one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we are regularly quoting because we really <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is a threat that we have to take into account. </p>
<p>In any case, it is already being very predictable that you have little <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> on what we will do next month. </p>
<p>What we have to deliver is price stability in the medium run and what I have observed in the past is that the contribution of administered prices on inflation has been substantial year after year after year -- even if it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> bizarre, because we should not normally have to cope with such a big contribution of administered prices. </p>
<p>The three last figures we have on M1 are 7.4%, 7.2% and 7.1%, which <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that the most liquid component of M3 is a little less dynamic. </p>
<p>And I would say that if some are augmented, for example I understand pretty well why tobacco should be augmented -- there is absolutely no problem there, although I think that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the smokers in this room would not be at all satisfied -- but I would say for health reasons we can have good reason to do that. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2006-12-07</b>, 51 sentences</p></div><p>We think that there are more upside than downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>At the same time the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> more acute. </p>
<p>Everybody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see what we did in the past and make a judgement. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 2.5 times the growth of the GDP in value terms. </p>
<p>As regards you last question on wages I think it is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which we do consider to be on the upside. </p>
<p>Again, we have to be as clear as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>: that particular interpretation would not be correct. </p>
<p>So I was very clear on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth, which we see as being on the downside. </p>
<p>As regards the euro, I stick to what I said before:" excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth ''. </p>
<p>Whatever pros and cons <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have been put forward as arguments, the conclusion of the European Commission, the ECB and the European Council was that we had a Treaty and that we had to stick to the Treaty. </p>
<p>I stick to what, on behalf of the Governing Council, I have signed a few sentences with the colleagues of the G7, including the sentence" Excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. '' </p>
<p>They capture <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> very well and there are a great number of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that in your articles, editorials and judgement, you also have a wide range of views. </p>
<p>So you have both: continued exceptional prosperity and more <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> at a global level. </p>
<p>But I think it would be wrong to conclude that the implicit real number within the range is this or that, because we are speaking of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and not already of materialisation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>In the same week you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have a number of signals. </p>
<p>When I mention the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of further inflation that would be due to indirect taxes or administrative taxes, I am not thinking about VAT. </p>
<p>Even if those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> did not materialise, but when they materialise -- it is too late. </p>
<p>As regards the changes in the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> concerning inflation, I mentioned traditional <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> but, in the case of wages, we have the sentiment that we have to be particularly attentive to this element of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>We take our decision on the basis of our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> analysis of threats to price stability on the medium run, and we decide accordingly to counter those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in order to deliver price stability and be credible in this delivery over time on the medium, long and very long term. </p>
<p>And that is the reason why we are so determined to take any occasion to say: let 's embark resolutely on structural reform, let 's complete the Single Market, let 's have an integration of financial markets which would be as complete as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, let 's let the workers of Slovenia go to the rest of the euro area... </p>
<p>What is correct is that, as always, we reserve the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> to act any time, as I said, we do not pre-commit for two, three, four, five, six months later. </p>
<p>I am thinking about what would or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come in all countries in Europe on top of what has already been decided and taken into account today. </p>
<p>What is <span class='uncertainty'>unknown</span>, obviously, is exactly the impact it will have ; the part of it which will be cushioned by some diminution of margins, the part of it which materialise in the prices. </p>
<p>We are speaking of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And I concluded, we" will monitor very closely all developments '' in <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>I said myself it is data -- <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span>. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> repeat it if you wish:" after today 's increase, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels ''. </p>
<p>I know that there are more optimistic schools that are thinking that we can see now the results of previous structural reforms and I do not dispute that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be argued. </p>
<p>The issue is disputed, you have several schools, but there is a broad agreement that this under-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> can not last forever, and that we have to pave the way for an orderly adjustment of this situation at the global level, which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain why real rates are low, spreads are low, insurance premia are low, <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is relatively low, all this in historical terms, of course. </p>
<p>To conclude on that we have the sentiment at a global level ; it is true of course in each particular vast economy like the US or us, or the UK or others, that there is presently some under-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general. </p>
<p>So all that I can tell you is that in that domain, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that permanent alertness is absolutely essential. </p>
<p>So, yes, there is a message there that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in that area <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be on the upside and, as you know, once the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have materialised, it is too late. </p>
<p>Let us see and wait a little bit to analyse that as closely as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, see what is cyclical and what is structural in the recent evolutions. </p>
<p>In our Eurosystem staff projections we have a large range which has been <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> upwards. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the IMF and the OECD <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> growth in the euro area at 2% or more. </p>
<p>When making a judgement on growth, you can see that all institutions are <span class='uncertainty'>predicting</span> growth for next year that would obviously be quite flattering. </p>
<p>To go back to your remark when I speak of downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth, I am referring to the general downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have listed, namely the pressures of protectionism, the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of further increases in the prices of oil and commodities -- let us not forget that there are also all other commodities -- and also other global threats that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> hamper growth in the euro area, but I would not refer particularly to the Italian decision. </p>
<p>That being said, we strongly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that a very important factor in making productivity progress materialise is the flexibility of the economy. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it has been an exemplary cooperation with us in particular and with the other European institutions to pave the way for the best transition <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And I fully confirm we are <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>, we are <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on data, deep analysis and judgement. </p>
<p>Again, there is no materialisation as yet of this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> at the level of the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>It is as simple as that, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span> regarding our own monetary policy concept. </p>
<p>We take growth into account to the extent that it augments or diminishes the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of inflation -- an inflation which would not be in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>We are not arbitrating between the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of inflation and the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth. </p>
<p>We are always" <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> '' but that does not mean that we do not extract the trend from the data. </p>
<p>I will not comment on any particular meaning that the last sentence <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have but it has no other meaning besides what it says:" the Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments ''. </p>
<p>Then, after a long period of maturation, in 1995-96 we saw the end of the paradox, because we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see a significant change in labour productivity increases. </p>
<p>There is a lot of information in such projections, which capture the modelling by our staff, the understanding of the interplay and interaction between all <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, and an element of judgement by staff. </p>
<p>But we expect of course that the active pursuit of structural reforms, if they continue to be implemented as actively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, will permit us to have a better position as regards labour productivity and then, by way of consequence, as regards the growth potential. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> to be even more dynamic than all observers would think. </p>
<p>As regards labour productivity, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the labour productivity increases that we are aiming for <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the dynamism of the private sector and on a number of phenomena that are very complex. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-01-11</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>I would not say anything here that would change expectations in the market that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do something at the end of the first quarter. </p>
<p>We all know that and that adds up to the current <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your question on the counterparts of M3, one of the great advantages of our own methodology with the two pillars is that, when we look at the monetary pillar, we are bound to try to understand as thoroughly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> the dynamics of all components, and not only M3 alone. </p>
<p>But, taking everything into account and with all due taking into account for the various <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> distributions, we consider the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to be on the upside ; that is absolutely clear. </p>
<p>On the second question, we are clearly experiencing an episode where <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is high and we have several illustrations of that. </p>
<p>I would mention three major <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that the Governing Council sees at the present juncture, the rise of protectionism, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of oil price increases and the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. </p>
<p>On the VAT, just as the Fed has been vindicated by facts, figures and its own assessment of what was likely to be observed in the US as regards the conjuncture -- as we ourselves were vindicated in respect of our judgement at the end of 2005 and in 2006 on what was going on -- all the information we have until now more or less confirms that the reasonable assessment we had on the VAT impact on the German economy and, of course, on the economy of the euro area as a whole was <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> well-founded. </p>
<p>Taking all things into account, it is clear that, for us, it signals series of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the medium to longer term. </p>
<p>Of course it is a balance, and you have a certain <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that things <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also improve a little bit. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the expectations have has not necessarily been made on the basis of what I say on behalf of the Governing Council, but rather on the basis of the figures that are available, the facts that are given and the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> made. </p>
<p>On you first point the sentiment of the Governing Council is that the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability is on the upside. </p>
<p>We also have to recognise, even if we do not have any other objective <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> but to take future prices in account that these future prices are not a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> -- at the moment we speak -- more than 315 million people in the euro area including Slovenia ; and it is for these more than 315 million people that we have to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>As regards our profit and loss it is very likely we will post a profit which will go to a reserve position in order to permit us to face up <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future challenges. </p>
<p>We always reserved the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> to judge and assess the situation in line with our definition of price stability and our monetary policy concept. </p>
<p>You will also have noted, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, that I did not use the words" strong vigilance ''. </p>
<p>And this time, I am telling you again exactly this: we are not pre-committed, we will do what will be necessary and I even went a little bit further in saying that I did n't see the necessity to change present expectations as regards <span class='uncertainty'>probabilities</span> as regards the future. </p>
<p>We never said that everybody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> expect an increase of rates every meeting, every two meetings or every three meetings. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what is likely to happen this year looks encouraging, of the order of magnitude of what has been observed last year. </p>
<p>But it 's a question of <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> ; it 's never a question of 100% certainty and I do not exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> surprise the market. </p>
<p>We consider that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, a reasonable level of <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> is not to be rejected. </p>
<p>These are low-probability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> but grave <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It 's a question of appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span>. </p>
<p>I do n't want to confirm anything except what is in the market as regards future <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> which, as I said, does n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me aberrant on the basis of the present level of information. </p>
<p>But, at this stage and in the present circumstances, I think the rather high level of <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> that we have as regards decisions that are taken on the very day of the meeting -- is appropriate for us. </p>
<p>This does not mean that we have no <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we have <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are clearly on the downside. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-02-08</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>I had the occasion recently to make public some comparisons that were more flattering for the euro area than has been <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> said. </p>
<p>As regards the percentage of counterfeit banknotes, the latest information that I have is that we are in a situation which is of the same order of magnitude as we had before but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even better. </p>
<p>Observers -- as lucid and vigilant as you -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> concluded that we were increasing rates every three months in the first half of 2006. </p>
<p>Today, I can tell you that we see inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the medium term on the upside, as I said earlier. </p>
<p>And in my introductory statement I had mentioned <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>First question -- we will see what will be in our next projections, and I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> in any respect the next projections -- they <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on a number of parameters and on the work that will be done by our staff. </p>
<p>Then, for reasons that were entirely due to the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we had identified and the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> according to our final judgement following our two pillars of analysis, economic and monetary analysis, we increased rates every two months in the second part of the year. </p>
<p>Second, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I listed on behalf of the Governing Council will not surprise you ; there is the stronger pass-through of past oil price increases than previously <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, and that remains a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>We are always <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>. </p>
<p>Let me mention the December 2006 increase in outstanding loans to non-financial corporation of 13%, which is high, and <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> a little less than three times the growth of GDP in value terms. </p>
<p>Finally, I think you are right to underline the issue of wages and salaries as a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>: it is clear that we have a message there today. </p>
<p>We do what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have to do and, of course, the circumstances are changing, the environment is changing, new data are coming in, such as the good surprise as regards growth last year. </p>
<p>However, it is not to say that we are living in the best of all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> worlds. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that, last time, this anonymous communication proved to be totally wrong. </p>
<p>You are absolutely right to say that, when looking at the counterparts of the monetary aggregate and, in particular, when looking at the external counterpart, we can see that there is room for further work to gain a better understanding of what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have happened in this respect. </p>
<p>I would not jump to a definitive working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> -- as you are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> -- that it is carry-trade. </p>
<p>As regards the profile, we are in the domain of <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span>, because it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on a number of parameters that we, of course, do n't have control of, namely the price of oil and of other commodities. </p>
<p>But we would certainly have, over time, an increase in the pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be more in line with a good and appropriate assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at the global level. </p>
<p>We have also the administered prices and indirect taxes which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go over and above what has been <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> and priced in present projections: our projections, as well as the projections of the market, of the observers and economists. </p>
<p>This is not to say that we are living in the best of the worlds <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I wanted to make clear that we know in advance, on the basis of present information as regards the price of oil, in particular, that we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have a particular profile in the course of 2007, with diminishing yearly inflation rates month after month due to base effects and then a picking-up at the end of the year. </p>
<p>We know that this will not last for ever and I have myself said a number of times that I trust that part of the phenomena we are observing today -- the low level of spreads, the low level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, the low level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia -- are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> characteristic of a transitory period in the financial market, corresponding to an under-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general. </p>
<p>As regards carry trade at the global level, it is clear that we do have that phenomenon -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more visibly for other currencies than for ours -- and it is true that it is a phenomenon that is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> also triggered, or fostered, by the low level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that we are currently observing in the global financial markets. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-03-08</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>What we do is, we assess the situation, we make a judgement on the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and we do exactly what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> to be correct in order to counter those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It represents a more realistic appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general. </p>
<p>Wages are very important for us, as always, because of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of second-round effects and, also, because we have to take into account different situations. </p>
<p>Again, some re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is welcome ; abrupt moves are not welcome. </p>
<p>We have to permanently make judgements on the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the medium term and we will do whatever we consider necessary to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also have noted that I said that we continue to be on the accommodative side and that interest rates are moderate. </p>
<p>On the monopoly issue, central bank money is a product which can be offered by central banks only, but the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of providing the necessary securities for settlement will remain open in the future, because the T2S system will not be mandatory. </p>
<p>It is also in line with the Treaty that the European Central Bank <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> provide facilities in this context. </p>
<p>As regards your consideration on financial stability at a global level, I have already mentioned that we considered that there were a number of elements at the level of global finance that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> progressively be corrected and, in particular, the under-pricing of certain <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> I have mentioned. </p>
<p>We are totally open, we are totally transparent, and we firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that something has to be done and that the present situation is not -- as Gertrude said -- optimal, neither from the competition standpoint nor from the financial integration standpoint, which is very important for us as well as for the Council and the Commission. </p>
<p>Therefore we think that our facility would open the market to competition -- would increase competition -- and this <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be a reason to offer these services. </p>
<p>Gertrude, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you be more precise? </p>
<p>You had, in particular, some parameters that were moved in one day, whereas in the previous episode -- when you had some kind of re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in 2006 -- the same levels of corrections took much more time. </p>
<p>Concerning the recent events that we have observed, it is true that the Governing Council of the ECB widely felt -- and I would say that it was very largely a consensus, a consensus that I myself have expressed on a number of occasions as the chairman of the G10 group of central bank governors -- that we were <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> in a phase in global finance where <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general were not necessarily assessed at their real price. </p>
<p>I said that we will monitor all developments very carefully so that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability do not materialise. </p>
<p>This was materialising in the levels of spreads and <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and in a number of other considerations, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> including low real interest rates. </p>
<p>We have had no ex ante concept, but we have always said that at any time we will do what is necessary to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>In the context of this favourable environment, orderly phenomena of the type I have mentioned <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be observed in the period to come. </p>
<p>What we have been observing for a number of days has been a certain re-assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside and across the board and a higher level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>We exchange all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> views. </p>
<p>If I read the report correctly, he referred to a <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span>. </p>
<p>We would at this stage not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we consider our growth potential for the euro area to have changed significantly upwards. </p>
<p>But we publish ranges and the ranges also capture the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which characterises all projections. </p>
<p>We expect, of course, in the medium and long run that, if we continue to be steady on structural reforms, we will observe -- progressively -- something of that sort, but so far, we do not consider it to be documented or substantiated and that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> retain it. </p>
<p>I would not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we would change anything at this stage. </p>
<p>When we extract information from the financial markets, we have a level of break-even for inflation expectations that is in line with our definition of price stability when you deduct the appropriate <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia, and it is the same with the surveys that are done. </p>
<p>One of the questions I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that you ask yourself is, how is it the case that this monetary pillar served the central banks so well that they delivered price stability and that they were credible in the delivery of price stability? </p>
<p>And we had a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> in 2003. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we are very transparent. </p>
<p>We also -- including myself -- were referring to what Minister Omi and Governor Fukui had said ; I said that I had noted myself that they said" that they <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery path and that the exchange rates should reflect these economic fundamentals ''. </p>
<p>First of all, there has always been discussion among us on the assets and liabilities of all <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> but there was no discussion of any 50-basis point interest rate increase. </p>
<p>We said that in the <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-04-12</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>And I also said after some comments made by Minister Omi and Governor Fukui that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery and that the exchange rate should reflect these economic fundamentals. </p>
<p>I also mentioned explicitly the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> unwinding of global imbalances. </p>
<p>You know that when I mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we had in front of us, coming from the international environment, I mentioned explicitly the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> rise of oil. </p>
<p>We never pre-commit in advance and I will not comment on what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen in the months to come. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you have noted that I have mentioned in my introductory remarks an analysis of the situation which is extremely close to the analysis we made in our last meeting, which is not surprising, because everything that we have observed since then has confirmed what we had envisaged in our last meeting. </p>
<p>Most of the new information we have had -- and it is true that it is good -- confirms our positive judgement, in particular on the real economy, and we have the same analysis as regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, both for the real economy and for inflation. </p>
<p>I would say it is a way to sum up the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we see in the international arena, including, of course, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are embedded in global finance. </p>
<p>But if you are in a position where there are <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about your present level of cost competitiveness, then of course wage moderation remains absolutely of the essence. </p>
<p>So, I do not have any particular comment on what the United States <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do, or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not do. </p>
<p>As regards M3, I would say that, as you know, we look at the monetary pillar with a view to understanding as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> the complex dynamics that underlie it. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember that I said several times that, on the basis of our cross-checking of the economic analysis and the monetary analysis, we had judged it to be time to increase rates. </p>
<p>At this moment in time, let me only say that we all agreed in Essen that excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be improved at a global level, because we have still significant differences on a transatlantic basis and at a global level. </p>
<p>You know that they always <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on facts and figures. </p>
<p>I am not <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that you now have a magic wand and you say:" The euro is there, you create jobs '', but let us be aware of the facts and figures, as always. </p>
<p>As regards Germany, we have noted -- not only for Germany but, more broadly, at the level of the euro area -- that a number of indicators confirm what we <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> to be the case, namely that we were in a process where growth continued to be there at the beginning of this year. </p>
<p>Each of us -- the 19 -- fully accept that other colleagues <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have good arguments -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have good analyses -- that are worth being examined and incorporated in this collective collegial wisdom that I have to express as the spokesman. </p>
<p>On the first question, I would say that there was no discussion on an increase in interest rates today, and as always, we weighed up the pros and cons associated with various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>. </p>
<p>If I take the example of one particular country -- I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take many of them -- the case of France: since the euro was created, around two million jobs have been created in France during those eight years. </p>
<p>There is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of disorderly correction of this situation, which is, again, associated with the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. </p>
<p>We also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there is no room for complacency because the convergence process is certainly a very important one and very ambitious one, taking into account the starting point. </p>
<p>Germany had very flattering growth last year and <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be continuing to record significant growth even in the first quarter. </p>
<p>We have already an instrument that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> to be a very good one. </p>
<p>And this is not new, because I already said that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there are in global finance a level of spreads, a level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, a level of low long-term rates, a level of pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general in the global economy that would not necessarily be sustainable in the medium and long run. </p>
<p>At the present moment, no, I can not tell you that in our judgement we have to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the growth potential for the euro area upwards. </p>
<p>We think that what we are observing as regards labour productivity <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be linked to the cycle, and we are looking at it very carefully because it is a very important parameter for us of course. </p>
<p>What we are telling Romania is that we encourage Romania to reform as efficiently as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>At this stage we do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we can conclude with sufficient certainty that there has been a change in total factor productivity or in labour productivity that would permit us to say that the growth potential is higher than before. </p>
<p>The fact that we are in a mode of robust growth is evidently something that we take into account as an element which creates an environment for <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that is different from what you would have if growth was not that robust. </p>
<p>I will confirm what I said, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> when responding to one of your own earlier questions. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be improved more, and better harmonised. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-05-10</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>And that there is absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span>, we are in a posture of strong vigilance. </p>
<p>I have also mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. </p>
<p>As regards the most recent observations in Ireland, I would very much like John to comment on your question but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we have been going in the right direction, and the signs are that the tensions that were observed in the past are progressively, slowly, cooling down. </p>
<p>And, as regards prices, it is precisely because we consider that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside in terms of price stability that I have mentioned this posture of strong vigilance. </p>
<p>All this is important and we work a lot to understand as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> the dynamics of the counterparts, the dynamics of the components that are making up M3 in a context which is very peculiar, in particular with this low level of long-term rates the flatness in the yield curve being the mark of the present situation. </p>
<p>At this stage, I will only say that after June we will do whatever is necessary to ensure price stability and that is of course on the basis of this fundamental working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> made by all the investors, savers and market participants that we can have the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability and that is true for the next five or ten years. </p>
<p>Of course we always analyse <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, and I have mentioned very explicitly the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we see. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> mention many colleagues, including the Governor of Bank of England, who have mentioned very explicitly that it was certainly an area where a lot of pertinent information <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be obtained for central banks and for their decision-making processes. </p>
<p>I have also mentioned the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the real economy that are mainly stemming from external observations that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on the side of the global real economy and I have mentioned in particular protectionism. </p>
<p>So again this anchoring is based upon the right <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we do what is necessary to do to deliver price stability and are credible in the delivery of price stability over time. </p>
<p>In relation to the Irish property market, you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> will recall that last year, house prices in Ireland were rising at about 15% and at that time, I indicated clearly that I thought that that level of increase was too high and I thought that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be sustained. </p>
<p>I have mentioned a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> increase of oil and commodity prices. </p>
<p>To give you precise figures: for example in March we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that outstanding loans to the financial corporate were still very dynamic, at 12.4%. </p>
<p>And I have mentioned as regards the structure of the components that we were reasonably happy to see that M1 had slowed down -- but I have to mention that in the most recent period of time we have seen this slowdown <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> interrupted. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> add that we are permanently reflecting on the disorderly unwinding of what I would call in global finance the certain degree of under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, which is also something that we have to consider as a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>On the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of M3, money and credit developments, let me say that we were quite explicit in the introductory remarks, in mentioning that we have had some indications that previous interest rate increases were modifying the structure of M3, the structure of its components and the structure of its counterparts. </p>
<p>That being said, over the medium to long term, the <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> of money growth from the reference value should not be and has never been interpreted mechanically. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> add a number of other elements that are very telling in terms of the performance that we have had and we trust profoundly were achieved thanks to our credibility in the delivery of price stability. </p>
<p>It is absolutely true that among the counterparts of M3 that <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> particularly dynamic, in the most recent month, we have the external counterpart. </p>
<p>It was reiterated at the time of the <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> we made in 2003. </p>
<p>I mentioned that it is from the international environment that we see the main <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, which would be downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the real economy in Europe. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the trend would go in the right direction at the level of Ireland but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> John would like to say a word on that. </p>
<p>We knew at the time that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> n't continue on like that and now it has reduced. </p>
<p>Just to pick up on that point in relation to the trend on the CPI and the trend on the HICP: It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us that for 2007 we would expect the harmonised index to be about 2.5% and the CPI which, as you know, is affected by mortgage interest rates, to be about 4.8%. </p>
<p>This country you are mentioning is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a country, which is growing rapidly. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, I have mentioned explicitly a number of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We were n't happy when we were talking about an increase of 15% and, as I said, we knew that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be sustained. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-06-06</b>, 50 sentences</p></div><p>A lot of things are being done but it is our duty to encourage all participants, including the private sector, to be as active as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in doing a good job in this respect. </p>
<p>So the supervisory authorities would be called upon to ensure that the core intermediaries, particularly the big commercial and investment banks that are in direct contact with the hedge funds, have the best <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management practices <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, are correctly enlightened on all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> they are taking and have a correct understanding and a correct information on what the hedge funds are doing. </p>
<p>There are, as I said, good reasons for <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to be priced as they are. </p>
<p>I mentioned the fact that in the case of other economies, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, this engine was not important. </p>
<p>So, I would have a relatively positive judgement on their awareness that they are living in an environment which includes <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and that it is their duty to take into account those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to be ready to weather a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> materialisation of those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>That is very important and very impressive, and it shows the extent to which things <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> change quite rapidly in the present functioning and development of the European economy. </p>
<p>They have improved their own resilience, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>I do not want to elaborate more on that, other than to say that, in any case, the needle of our compass is that we make a judgement on what is necessary to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at any given moment. </p>
<p>We have been working a lot to improve, in particular, <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management and I take it again that it would be equally wrong to be too complacent and to underestimate the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and also to say nothing is being done. </p>
<p>Our judgement today is that, for the longer term, there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability embedded in what we are observing, even if the dynamics are very different as regards a number of counterparts. </p>
<p>All this taken into account, I would say that we are -- all of us, because we were in very good agreement -- saying that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have to pave the way for some kind of orderly and smooth adjustment associated with the <span class='uncertainty'>reassessment</span> of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And that creates the present observation that the pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is lower than it would be in -- I would say -- more normal times. </p>
<p>And on the basis of our understanding of these dynamics we conclude that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability in the longer term are signalled by this overall analysis. </p>
<p>At this stage, I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that there is a consensus that we should make progress along all the lines I have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, including the call to the industry itself to work out voluntarily what these benchmarks would be. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> call that a set of principles and I am very attached personally to the voluntary principles or benchmarks for appropriate behaviour and conduct that would be devised by the industry itself. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> know, in the Financial Stability Report that we have published we mentioned explicitly that this was a very important issue. </p>
<p>So I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> a decision which is a very important one and will be made at the appropriate level, namely at the level of Heads of States and Governments. </p>
<p>You have the fact that in a number of economies, not in Europe now, but in a number of economies you had physical investment by corporate businesses that were lower than what would have been <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> by econometric equations based on past observations and it is certainly the case in the United States. </p>
<p>And you had also among all those reasons the remarkable creativity that we are observing in the global financial markets as regards derivatives and the way of splitting, of repackaging, of reformatting <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> with the consequence of enlarging formidably the scope of the investors that are <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> buyers. </p>
<p>So all this <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> a picture with strong points and weak points and we will see when the time comes what the position of the various authorities concerned, including of course the government and the central bank of Bulgaria, would be. </p>
<p>We judge what is necessary to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in various circumstances, and circumstances do not cease to change. </p>
<p>A number of market participants are mentioning liquidity to characterise the situation where they see" capital chasing investment '' or" money chasing ideas '', something which they note as being a little bit exceptional, because in other times, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> in more normal times, you see the contrary, you see" ideas chasing money or capital '', you see" investment chasing financing or capital ''. </p>
<p>It is our duty to signal <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and it is part of the signalling of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that permits global finance and the global economy to be as impressive as they are. </p>
<p>And the hedge funds themselves are called upon to work out benchmarks on what would be the best behaviour <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> as regards transparency vis-à-vis core intermediaries and transparency vis-à-vis their own investors -- those individuals or entities that are giving them their capital -- and a benchmark for their own internal <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management systems. </p>
<p>What we are doing together, the central bank constituency on the one hand, the banking supervisory authorities on the other hand, as well as the industry, is to be done as seriously as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to weather the adjustment when shocks materialise. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also see such sentiment expressed in a number of other central banks. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us that it would be very important that the negotiation drives Cyprus and consequently the euro area in the best and soundest position <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>There are various figures <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on certain methodologies. </p>
<p>The biggest challenges, again, are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the structural reforms and the overall sustainable delivery of a good macroeconomic policy -- that is what really counts. </p>
<p>They have improved their <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management concepts across the board. </p>
<p>At the present moment, as I said, we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability do not materialise over the medium term. </p>
<p>We are free to do what we would judge appropriate when the time comes, but at the present moment, I do n't want to comment any more on <span class='uncertainty'>probabilities</span>. </p>
<p>So it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that Romania has a lot of homework to do. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me very clear that this means structural reforms, it means sound fiscal policy, it means sound monetary policy and also pursue liberalisation of all markets. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> mention house purchases, the financing of house purchases, in the same way: in April 8.6%, in February 9.4%. </p>
<p>This is considered by us as important, enlightening and as something which allows us to take the wisest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decision on the basis of this binocular approach that we are very attached to. </p>
<p>On the United States of America: I have always said that we very much rely upon the analysis of the Federal Reserve System and that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that their analysis is a pertinent one. </p>
<p>We have the same vision of the monetary analysis as being deep, broad, as aiming at having as profound an understanding as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> of the various dynamics that are inside the various components, the sectoral breakdown and the counterparts. </p>
<p>A number of surveys <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we are around 1.9%, which is in line with our definition. </p>
<p>I have to say that what we have seen till now has been, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, quite well understood and absorbed by markets that have proved to be resilient, and I expect that it will continue to be so. </p>
<p>To your first question: again, we do what is necessary to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to be able to permanently deliver price stability over the medium term, which is the pertinent horizon. </p>
<p>But, again, I do n't exclude that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> modify our assessment -- at this stage it would be premature. </p>
<p>A number of events have been observed in the past and will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> continue to be observed in China. </p>
<p>And I do not want to elaborate too much on these reasons, but publicly, yesterday, on the occasion of the International Monetary Conference, together with Ben Bernanke and Toshihiko Fukui, we had elaborated on that and I had myself said: Look, you have <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> five reasons why we are observing that ex ante savings are at a global level superior to ex ante investment. </p>
<p>On top of that, let us not forget that the real economy is performing well at a global level, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us that it is our duty to say: let us calmly prepare for a smooth and orderly <span class='uncertainty'>reassessment</span> of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> when the time comes, in order to avoid what would not be good for the real global economy, namely an adjustment which would not be orderly and smooth. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, on the basis of all that we are observing, it is justified to say that we are still on the accommodative side. </p>
<p>I think there is nothing really new in the message of the Governing Council in this respect ; it is an elaboration on that kind of <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we see in the global economy. </p>
<p>It is good to enter when you are as fit as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We, again, are making our own judgement, based on collegial wisdom and on experience, on the basis of all information that is pertinent in order to counter the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>At this stage, on behalf of the Governing Council, I would say that I stick to what we had already said, with the sentiment that at around 2.25% we <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> are in an area which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be pertinent. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-07-05</b>, 35 sentences</p></div><p>It undoubtedly has an impact on inflation and Germany represents <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 30% or more of euro area GDP. </p>
<p>We support the full-fledged achievement of the single market in all domains because we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is a prerequisite for continued prosperity, growth and job creation in Europe. </p>
<p>And I mentioned both September and October because, according to all that I have seen, there are certain <span class='uncertainty'>probabilities</span> that are attached to September and other <span class='uncertainty'>probabilities</span> that are attached to October, and, on behalf of the Governing Council, I do not want to change in any respect what you saw this morning in the various computations. </p>
<p>And, having been involved in negotiating the Maastricht Treaty myself, I am absolutely impressed by the fact that when we negotiated the Treaty we had in mind that we would number <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> seven or eight, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> less. </p>
<p>To your first question: any indications that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be given in respect of a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> weakening of the fiscal consolidation would be against, I repeat, against the decisions that have been taken by the various governments themselves, against the recommendations and decisions that have been taken within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact upon the proposal of the Commission and against the Berlin Agreement I referred to in the introductory remarks. </p>
<p>As regards VAT, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see yourself what has happened with the VAT decision in Germany. </p>
<p>That being said, I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> the meeting which will take place next Monday at the level of the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>We do whatever is necessary and we are never pre-committed, but I would validate the present interpretation by observers and markets of what it means exactly in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span>, expectation, when we say it. </p>
<p>These differences will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> diminish over time. </p>
<p>We can now see a pick-up in Germany and a slowing down in a number of countries: I remember I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that in Ireland when we had the outside Governing Council meeting in Dublin and we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that also for Spain, so we see something like a progressive" rapprochement ''. </p>
<p>As regards your third question on structural reforms, again, I do not <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> the next meeting and meetings of the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>In addition, we advocate proceeding in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> against protectionism at a global level, and that is because we think that protectionism at a global level <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to global growth and global job creation. </p>
<p>As regards what will be said at the next meeting of the Eurogroup, I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> ; it is a meeting of the Eurogroup and it will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on what will be said by the various delegations -- not by only one, but by the various delegations that will present their own situations and intentions. </p>
<p>I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> the conclusion which will be drawn following the proposal of the Commission by Jean-Claude Juncker as Chairman of the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>And I can never repeat that often enough because it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that this is the main message. </p>
<p>I have already noted here that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> simultaneously see the slowing down of the pace of price increases and the slowing down of the growth of outstanding credit in a number of economies that had observed a great level of buoyancy in the real estate market. </p>
<p>I refer to the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that one would extract, oneself, with very sophisticated tools from the present market, and nothing else. </p>
<p>The position of this institution, as agreed upon by the Governing Council, and that of our major partners at the level of the G7, is that we consider excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates to be undesirable for economic growth. </p>
<p>I remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because on that point with regard to consumer credit for households, the figures for February, March, April and May are 6.7%, 7.1%, 6.9% and 5.9%. </p>
<p>I have also noted that all European voices have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> sticking to this long-standing tradition. </p>
<p>This suggestion has already been made in the past and it was examined during the discussions about <span class='uncertainty'>revising</span> the Stability and Growth Pact in 2004. </p>
<p>I have been invited by Jean-Claude Juncker to participate in the Eurogroup meeting and I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> what will be said there. </p>
<p>And that on the basis of all that we have seen since our decision in December 2005 to increase rates to counter the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we were noticing at that time, we have been, at least until now, fully vindicated in the sentiment that we were helping sustainable growth and job creation. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> of course also embark on national data in various countries. </p>
<p>Our message applies to absolutely all countries, but in particular to those countries where we think that there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of the commitments undertaken not being respected ; in particular the Berlin commitment, which I mentioned in the introductory remarks, and the full implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact with a number of provisions that we will certainly insist on. </p>
<p>We are listing this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> as one of the important <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that would weigh down on the global economy. </p>
<p>After appropriate discussion in Essen and in Washington, I myself noted that our Japanese colleagues, both the Minister of Finance and the Governor, said they <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the Japanese economy is on a sustainable recovery path and that the exchange rates should reflect these economic fundamentals. </p>
<p>Everything taken into account, when we extract all the information from these data we see that in the medium to longer term the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside, and this is what I said on behalf of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>As I remember, this suggestion was rejected <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> unanimously at that time by members of the Eurogroup and of the ECOFIN Council, because the Stability and Growth Pact is an ECOFIN instrument. </p>
<p>Let me repeat that we are <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>As regards Slovakia, we do not have a position of the Governing Council on Slovakia and I do not want to comment on question marks that one <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have, which are fully legitimate. </p>
<p>Exchange markets should be aware of the fact that there are two-way <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in any bet. </p>
<p>At this stage we do not have a Governing Council position on Slovakia and I strongly encourage Slovakia to embark resolutely on a convergence programme that would be as active and responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Regarding your second point, I do not see how President Sarkozy 's attendance at the meeting <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> change the dialogue between the ECB and the finance ministers. </p>
<p>This was the case in Berlin with the 0.5% reduction in the structural deficit year after year and with the commitment to reach the MTOs -- the medium-term objectives -- as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in any case by 2010 at the latest. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-08-02</b>, 14 sentences</p></div><p>That is something important and it would permit the evolution of the market to be as effective as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in terms of going back to a normal assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general. </p>
<p>We asked market participants and investors to be as keen as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to avoid sharp and abrupt corrections. </p>
<p>In the present episode, we see a process of re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general. </p>
<p>And I said that at a moment when there was no particular <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> on the market, but it was our judgement, our collegial appreciation. </p>
<p>The first quality to be demonstrated in circumstances when we see significant increases in measures of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in a large range of markets and asset classes by market participants and investors, and of course by authorities is to keep their composure. </p>
<p>On the second point, I told you and colleagues that are here that we thought at the level of the Governing Council, and also in the constituency of central bankers at a global level, that there had been in the past a degree of under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, some under-assessment of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And I would qualify this episode as a process of re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> which can be interpreted as a phenomenon of normalisation of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> pricing in a number of markets. </p>
<p>I mentioned already what our judgement was some time ago and, again, I see a phenomenon of normalisation of the assessment and pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>That being said, we constantly reflect on what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do in order to be as efficient as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in terms of our relationship with you. </p>
<p>On the overall assessment of the situation on the markets, I feel that we are observing a <span class='uncertainty'>reassessment</span> of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I also said that, in circumstances that are characterised by increasing <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and by the <span class='uncertainty'>reassessment</span> of a number of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in a number of markets, it was important that the market participants, investors and authorities, keep their composure, maintain their" sangfroid ''. </p>
<p>I said a number of weeks or months ago -- and I said it repeatedly -- that we were calling for an orderly and smooth re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We are in an episode where prices that were under-assessing an element of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in a number of markets are normalising. </p>
<p>You gave a lot of attention to the fact that the IMF had <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> up global growth and euro area growth. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-09-06</b>, 41 sentences</p></div><p>This is necessary for paving the way for appropriate sustainable growth and job creation, which is also essential as an element of confidence in the present circumstances, but we also have to continue doing what we have been doing, namely responding wisely, quickly, expeditiously and professionally to the challenges we face as regards the functioning of the money market, something I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have done well and will continue to do. </p>
<p>We judge the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the economy to the extent that they have a bearing on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, because the needle of our compass is always price stability ; and the anchoring of inflation expectations is always the most important thing for us, because it 's what our primary mandate calls for -- price stability and credibility in the delivery of price stability over time. </p>
<p>I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council the fact that we presently have a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>I also mentioned, and this is very important, that the anchoring of inflation expectations is all the more important in a period of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of financial markets, of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of global financial markets, because it provides for all agents, investors, savers, in Europe and in the world a solid base for their medium-term and long-term decisions. </p>
<p>It is a problem we see in a large array of segments of the money market, and a provisional conclusion I would draw from that situation is that once again -- but it is an observation I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make each time we had an episode of very excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the market -- transparency is of the essence. </p>
<p>I would myself call for increased transparency across the board as part of what we should <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> do. </p>
<p>But, on the other hand, we can not exclude that the present episode would <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to include elements that would have a serious bearing on the real economy. </p>
<p>We will therefore have to think about this again, and it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be appropriate to draw lessons in transparency from what we are observing now. </p>
<p>That said, we will have to draw lessons in all areas, the surveillance authorities, the level of vigilance of the financial institutions themselves and the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management within the financial institutions. </p>
<p>As far as the money market is concerned, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see what we have done and decided since 9 August and even today. </p>
<p>There are, in our view, upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, and on the other hand we have noted a number of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, and this has led us to take the decision announced today. </p>
<p>The long-term, the medium-to-long-term responsibility has to be fully <span class='uncertainty'>assumed</span>, and we have also, at whatever level of interest rates we are deciding to meet our medium-term goal, to help the money market to function. </p>
<p>What we are observing is that a large number of institutions, agents, investors, savers, are displaying attitudes of fear and of an absence of confidence which are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> due to a large extent to an absence of sufficient transparency. </p>
<p>It will be carried out as a <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender, with no preset allotment amount, and we will apply the standard tender procedure. </p>
<p>At this stage, the overall level of collateral that we see <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be sufficiently comfortable. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> myself find first pages of financial papers in which I had expressed that opinion, and it was very much the opinion of the central bank constituency. </p>
<p>But again, I am prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, and we have to be sure that we draw all the appropriate conclusions with the benefit of hindsight. </p>
<p>As I have said, it is too early to draw a definitive conclusion from the episode that we are experiencing, and do n't forget that I think we are presently in a period of high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a little bit early to draw definitive conclusions from what we have observed. </p>
<p>As I said, the dis-anchoring of inflation expectations would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be the worst thing that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>As regards what I would call the present episode of market correction, with its hectic episodes, elements of overshooting and increased <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, I would say we have to be pragmatic, as realistic as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and we have to do our job as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>The world over, nobody thinks that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be influenced. </p>
<p>And third, as you know, we do not compare the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability with the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the economy, and we do n't weigh these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> against each other. </p>
<p>But it is not the case, precisely because everybody knows that we are fiercely independent and that there is not the slightest <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we decide in this totally independent way. </p>
<p>On your first question, which is a good question, and I think permits me to provide <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span>: For reasons that are manifold, the Eurosystem has a relationship with the commercial banks which is such that the level of refinancing operations is very large in comparison with a number of other central banks, and in particular, I have to say, in comparison with the US Fed. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> I have been in touch with Ben something like five or six times during the period ; with Governor Fukui a little less, because we had <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> fewer exchanges of views to make, but nevertheless frequent contact. </p>
<p>So in normal times the order of magnitude of our outstanding refinancing operations, and of course, it is only an order of magnitude, because it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on the analysis of the liquidity need, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be something like $ 400 billion. </p>
<p>I said:"... strong vigilance is therefore of the essence to ensure that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the medium term do not materialise ''. </p>
<p>That is our main <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, but we fully accept that the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> has augmented in a significant fashion. </p>
<p>I also said that we were in a period of increased <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, which is associated with all the observations we have made since 2 August, but our baseline scenario, our main <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, remains that the real economy in Europe will behave properly. </p>
<p>On your first question: in what I said on behalf of the Governing Council, I was very clear on the fact that, for us, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are on the upside, that in our baseline scenario we will certainly have to consider that those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside. </p>
<p>That would be something which would be normal for us ; it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be more, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be less, but it is an order of magnitude. </p>
<p>So, in what is observed today, there are elements of correction that were diagnosed before the correction took place and, as is very often the case in such circumstances, there are hectic episodes in this correction, there is a level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that can be quite high and there is also a large deal of overshooting. </p>
<p>Second, and this is clear in the eyes of the ECB as well as in the eyes of the Fed -- even though I do not want to speak on behalf of the Fed -- in the eyes of all of my central banking colleagues: for quite a long period of time we had said that we were diagnosing a level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> appreciation in global finance that was signalling under-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general, which was illustrated in particular, but not exclusively, by the low level of spreads, the low level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and the low level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in a number of markets. </p>
<p>I also said:" Let me also say that we are experiencing a period of market nervousness, a period where we see <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in markets in general and re-appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>... We will continue to pay great attention to the developments in the market... '' It was a very short introductory remark to this press briefing and you have everything there. </p>
<p>In the United States it is about one tenth of that, so you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be surprised when you compare the figures, but they are not comparable. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that, with the benefit of hindsight, we would say that this has been an episode of correction of the pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the global economy and in global finance, and that we have finally been through a hectic period, including episodes of overshooting and intense <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> ; but that has driven us to a better appreciation of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia, both in general and in terms of global finance, making global finance healthier and global economic growth more sustainable in the long run. </p>
<p>Again, let us not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the appropriate functioning of the money market and the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>The liquidity needs are very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> in the present period. </p>
<p>For instance, an absence of sufficient transparency as regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that have been taken by institutions, as regards the very nature of the various assets that are backing commercial papers. </p>
<p>We must be credible in the delivery of price stability over time -- and as I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, this is all the more important in a period of market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, because it provides markets with a solid anchor for all expectations in the medium term. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-10-04</b>, 50 sentences</p></div><p>We are very insistent on the fact that against this background our monetary policy stance is weighted to counter upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability as it is required by our primary objective. </p>
<p>We look at the overall situation of the European economy and we analyse the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, as well as the repercussions of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> at global level on our own economy. </p>
<p>We are in a period of relative <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>It is all the more important, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, as regards the present episode of market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>So, yes at this stage, our baseline scenario remains the main scenario whilst we fully accept that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> have increased. </p>
<p>Again, our message is that there are upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability and we stand ready to counter these upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, to solidly anchor inflation expectations, to deliver price stability, and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. </p>
<p>As regards the money market, we acted when needed to permit the money market to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in line with our decisions as regards the interest rates for which we are responsible. </p>
<p>On the last point, Klaus, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> you would like to say a word? </p>
<p>Otherwise, we would not be doing our job of capturing all the elements that <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to be important. </p>
<p>I also mentioned that with money and credit growth vigorous in the euro area, monetary policy stands ready to counter upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>And, it is also very important for us to maintain confidence as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, because confidence is the key ingredient at the moment. </p>
<p>As I have said already on a number of occasions, we consider excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> very counterproductive from the standpoint of global growth and for the growth of all components of the global economy. </p>
<p>Exchange rates are one of the parameters to the extent that they influence <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>We underline the fact, that we stand ready to counter the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And I have already qualified what I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say on the dollar, on the yen and on the yuan, and I stick to what I have said. </p>
<p>The tightening <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> mainly to affect large transactions, such as loans granted to finance mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<p>And on the second point, I would say that I was clear in the diagnosis of the Governing Council that we consider that upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability are on our radar screen. </p>
<p>Now, taking into account all the new elements that have been observed in this recent period, I would say that we also need to reflect on the so-called conduits and so-called special vehicles, which are also non-regulated entities that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> prove to be the source of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> recall, these do not all <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that we would embark on the administrative regulation of these particular highly-leveraged institutions, but rather on a number of very important indirect moves with the full involvement of the core intermediaries, namely the prime brokers that are themselves under the jurisdiction of the banking surveillance authorities. </p>
<p>I accept that there is, de facto, a great signalling value in the word" vigilance '', although I always said -- and we proved it in the last months -- that it did not mean that there was a <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of 100% that we would do something, because I always accompany these words with" we are not pre-committed ''. </p>
<p>And we are never pre-committed, because we can always move when we judge that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability command a move from us. </p>
<p>We do not want to signal very subtle messages for you to prejudge what we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> do. </p>
<p>First of all, according to my information and as a result of the recent discussions I have had with one or another counterpart from one or another new Member State, I do not have the impression that the financial market <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> have spilled over. </p>
<p>We think that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside at the present moment, while, as I have already said, there are also <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we need more information to further analyse the situation. </p>
<p>And this has to be well understood ; to explain particularly these upside moves of the break even inflation, there are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> market elements, that are more or less associated with some kind of market corrections. </p>
<p>These tensions <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> in a very acute way on 9 August, and we acted immediately. </p>
<p>Upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on our radar screen and, as always, we confirm that we stand ready to act whenever it is necessary in order to solidly anchor these inflation expectations and be in line with our primary mandate. </p>
<p>It also calls for benchmarks for best behaviour to be set by the industry itself in order for the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management of these institutions to be optimal and the transparency of the hedge funds and highly-leveraged institutions vis-à-vis both their core intermediaries and vis-à-vis their investors to follow best practices. </p>
<p>I do not want to repeat the reasons why we judge that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> lie on the downside. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember that some were saying" you are at 1.7%, you are very low, you are below 2% '', but we have to look forward and looking forward, we knew that we would have a hump. </p>
<p>We analyse the real economy and, as I said, on balance, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for growth are judged to lie on the downside. </p>
<p>On the second question, we do not balance the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the real economy and the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability to make a judgement of which <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is more important. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> judge the reaction of the market, which of course has to be seen in a much longer perspective, some reactions were relatively positive. </p>
<p>I say <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the upside. </p>
<p>I do not say that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have materialised. </p>
<p>And from that standpoint, we see -- in contrast to what we have seen in the real economy -- <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside. </p>
<p>As I have very often said, we have a needle in our compass, and it is indicating the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, because our duty, our primary objective, is to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>But our decisions on monetary policy are based on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>If we wanted to communicate more simply, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say at the next meeting that the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that we increase rates is x%, the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that we leave rates unchanged is y% and so forth, but that is not the way we operate. </p>
<p>So I will not mention any particular instrument that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have discussed. </p>
<p>I would only say that we continue to do what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is necessary in the circumstances. </p>
<p>So, take our message as: -LRB- i -RRB- we confirm our baseline scenario as regards growth, -LRB- ii -RRB- we say that we have downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for that baseline scenario, and -LRB- iii -RRB- I will go back because it is your second question, we mentioned that with all this taken into account, we see upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, and we stand ready to counter these upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>At the present time, we think it appropriate to concentrate on the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we see, and to concentrate on the fact that we stand ready to counter these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> at any time. </p>
<p>It is something that we consider important and we do not want to enter into a debate on whether or not, given the increase that has been observed in the term money market rates or what has been observed on the exchange market, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> describe the monetary policy stance differently. </p>
<p>As regards market expectations, I will merely say that, at the moment and everything taken into account, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability are on the upside. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> are such that we need more information and data to further reflect on what and when it would be appropriate to counter these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the real economy, again, we see downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but at the present time we see <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> increasing. </p>
<p>I said that our baseline scenario was clearly in line with what we have already said, in line with the previous projections, but the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the downside. </p>
<p>We have to do whatever we judge necessary to continue to help the money market to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>In any case, when there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability which would threaten our delivery of price stability, even if we are not accommodative at all we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> increase rates, and if we are accommodative we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not increase rates, because, again, what we have to do is to deliver price stability and be absolutely credible in the delivery of price stability. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-11-08</b>, 40 sentences</p></div><p>I always ask all commercial banks -- all financial institutions -- to be as transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>In our own remarks, we also call upon absolutely all parties concerned to <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> their responsibilities. </p>
<p>It would also be in the interest of sustainable growth and job creation and help to keep inflation as low as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>That being said, we are asking for competition to be as intense as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the euro area. </p>
<p>You have heard it from the Governing Council when we had previous oil shocks or new <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>, sharp and abrupt increases of commodity prices or oil prices. </p>
<p>So, that is an indication that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have, and I will not comment on any particular provisioning of commercial banks. </p>
<p>It is extremely important that all parties concerned -- and this means all social partners and all economic agents which have pricing power -- <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> their responsibilities. </p>
<p>As I said before, it is a significant market correction with episodes of overshooting, of high <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and turbulent periods and it is an ongoing process that we are looking at very carefully. </p>
<p>Of course, you were right in saying that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth have their own impact on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation. </p>
<p>You know that I never respond to the question" How do you balance the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for inflation on the one hand and the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for growth on the other hand? '' </p>
<p>And this is what we have been doing since the start of the" <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> '', which I would call a significant market correction, and of course, it is what we will continue to do. </p>
<p>I have been very clear that the needle of our compass is inflation, and this needle signals <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I have noted since the beginning of the period of" <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> '' that we were all in different economies with various characteristics and with various instruments at our disposal, taking into account our own histories and our own structures. </p>
<p>The exchange rate is one of the parameters amongst many, many others that we look at when reaching conclusions on the inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and on our capacity in the medium term to deliver price stability in line with our definition. </p>
<p>I take it that what has been done has been responsible and I think we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly prove that we -- each of us, in our own environment -- <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> did what was required by the situation. </p>
<p>This puts us in a situation where the hump will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be a little bit longer, and certainly bigger in terms of absolute magnitude, than what we would have had, had we not had to incorporate the two elements that I have mentioned. </p>
<p>As regards the alertness of the ECB, I think that nobody has any <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about our alertness. </p>
<p>And I have said that our new information fully confirms the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we had identified. </p>
<p>Some are <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even decreasing in price, because of strong competition. </p>
<p>As regards our own monetary policy stance, we took a decision today, as we do at each of our meetings, based on what we judge to be appropriate in order to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to continue anchoring inflation expectations solidly. </p>
<p>So whether the observed pick up is reflecting or not something happening in the" pure '' inflation expectations or whether there is an increase of this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium -- which would not be surprising in the present period -- is a complex issue. </p>
<p>The correction had been identified a long time ago as <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> necessary, taking into account a number of phenomena that had been observed by the central bank constituency in particular, but not only by us: namely an underpricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on a series of markets and for a large number of instruments. </p>
<p>This is not particularly original, because it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is very much the attitude taken until now by most international institutions and observers. </p>
<p>You can <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> extract the sentiment of the market itself as regards the future evolution of the present market <span class='uncertainty'>anomalies</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the financial market situation, I said that we have the same level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> as that we had mentioned after our previous meeting. </p>
<p>Secondly, we had, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, explicitly sent a clear message to a number of currencies of emerging Asian markets including the Chinese currency. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that, in the most recent period of time, it has become even clearer that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States. </p>
<p>Inflation expectations and the delivery of price stability over time are totally <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the absence of these second-round effects in a period in which we have a hump in headline inflation. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Risks</span> for growth are in our judgement clearly on the downside. </p>
<p>I also stated on behalf of the Governing Council that the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> was on the downside. </p>
<p>We are experiencing a multi-dimensional correction with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, episodes with high level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, episodes of overshooting, and again it is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon that we have to follow very carefully. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be some communication phenomena, translation, a number of interpretations -- in my opinion, very much over-interpretation. </p>
<p>You had a second question on the liquidity injections: again, as I said, we ensure that money markets function as properly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> ; we did that in the past in a fashion that has been observed very carefully the world over. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>We always reserve at any time the right to move when we judge it to be necessary in order to counter the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in the medium term. </p>
<p>But it is complex because a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium is also incorporated in the figures that you obtain when you extract the break-even inflation rate. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and they are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have already mentioned. </p>
<p>So, it is clear from the cross-checking that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are there. </p>
<p>What is absolutely clear is that, because we had this additional element coming from agro-food products, processed food and oil, we have a figure, which at the level of the euro area as a whole, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be from 0.2% to 0.3% over and above the previous hump. </p>
<p>Again, we are qualifying the situation as -- without calling our baseline scenario into question at this stage -- one of growth that would be around potential, but I also said that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were on the downside. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2007-12-06</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>As regards your third question on the sub-prime issue, I said that there is certainly a significant level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>The most striking figure I can think of is that of loans to non-financial corporations, which are still growing at a rate of 13.9%, which is extraordinarily rapid and does not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we are experiencing a credit crunch. </p>
<p>So we call on the whole of the euro area -- not any one economy in particular, but the whole of the euro area -- to reinforce competition, having competition which is as fierce as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in the interests of consumers, in the interests of the economy as part of the completion of the Single Market, and of course in the interests of avoiding second-round effects. </p>
<p>One can always say" well, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> use another methodology ''. </p>
<p>Very often we are asked: how do you compare balance the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation and the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth? </p>
<p>Our staff is projecting that in 2009 we are likely to be back to our definition of price stability, but it is absolutely essential that the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that there will be no second-round effects is fully confirmed. </p>
<p>It is absolutely fundamental, it is a key working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>, and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that there is no materialisation of second-round effects. </p>
<p>That being said, all observers looking at the economy in Europe are seeing elements that <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we have a sound economy. </p>
<p>As regards your last question: it is very important for me to restate that what is absolutely decisive for all members of the Governing Council is that this working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of the staff as regards the absence of second-round effects be fully confirmed by what will really happen in the reality. </p>
<p>What the staff has worked out as far as economic growth is concerned <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me very much in line with the sentiment of the Governing Council that I expressed in the previous press conference, when I said that, in our opinion, we would be around potential, potential being around 2%. </p>
<p>I should also mention that, at the very moment I am speaking, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that the impact of the VAT increase in Germany <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be of the order of magnitude -- at the level of the euro area -- of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 0.4%. </p>
<p>We are all mutually influencing one another and if we have <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> events that would come from the US or from our neighbours or from Asia and Asian emerging economies, then it has an influence. </p>
<p>As regards the inflation projections, I said last time, that, as far as we were concerned, new information on oil price increases and on food products were <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that we would have a hump which would be higher, more protracted and longer than what had been previously projected. </p>
<p>I will comment on what we do taking into account all factors: the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability that are fully confirmed, the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in which we are presently and which is fully captured by the Governing Council, taking into account the fact that we remain constantly alert and are ready to act at any moment in order to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>I thought I had explained as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that the reappraisal of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by continued <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> of the potential impact on the real economy. </p>
<p>We have one needle, not two, and of course the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation is influenced by what we have as regards the pressure coming from the real economy, or absence of pressure, and all the other parameters that have an influence on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation. </p>
<p>And I make the point regularly here and this was <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the intention of my colleague. </p>
<p>But again, it does not mean that we are in any way mixing the present situation of the market correction -- the significant market correction with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> and so on and so forth -- with the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>This remark is also true for the real economy: at the present moment, we see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the real economy on the downside, for a number of reasons that we have listed, the same reasons that I listed at the last press conference. </p>
<p>And today we confirmed that 4% is what we think is appropriate, but we have also the responsibility of having the money market functioning as properly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> at that level. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that what has been said corresponds to the fact that we have one needle in our compass. </p>
<p>This has been disputed a little bit, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, in August, after the 9th and 10th of August. </p>
<p>But it is very important that we stick to this methodology, and the staff <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we should stick to this methodology. </p>
<p>And <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you have noted that the Governing Council also says that we should eliminate all traces of indexation in our economies, including wage and salary indexation, and we should reinforce as fiercely as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> competition for price-setters so that there are no second-round effects. </p>
<p>And I would say that particularly in periods of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, to have a steady hand and solid anchoring is absolutely essential. </p>
<p>You yourself expressed the computation of some mid-points, but what we are publishing is ranges, in order to reflect the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that exists for growth as well as for inflation. </p>
<p>We finally decided on the basis of a consensus after having exchanged all views and weighing up the two <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> very, carefully. </p>
<p>On the first question, as always, we examine all pros and cons, all assets and liabilities associated with the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions, the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions being increasing rates or maintaining rates as they were. </p>
<p>But again this is what we see today and we know that there are <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-01-10</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>But I think it would be wrong to think that <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> will evaporate by virtue of this. </p>
<p>So I would rather <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that you interpret our comments to mean that we have to take into account the fact that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> coming from the United States <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be strengthening. </p>
<p>I said on behalf of the Governing Council that we were prepared to act pre-emptively, so that second-round effects and upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability would not materialise and that, consequently, inflation expectations would remain anchored. </p>
<p>I would say that we permanently encourage Bulgaria to have the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> control over inflation and over the other elements that characterise the present pace of the real economy in Bulgaria, and the financial and monetary economy. </p>
<p>That being said, I would say that we had a very important discussion, weighing up very carefully the pros and cons of the various positions that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take, and ultimately came to the decision, -- by consensus -- that I have just explained. </p>
<p>I have to say that the futures market does not <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to be a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictive</span> indicator when you look at what has happened in the past. </p>
<p>I repeat: we will not tolerate a materialisation of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>What I have said is that in our own staff projections we looked at prices at a certain moment and then the futures market indicated what would be considered the best objective information, although the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of prices is very significant. </p>
<p>So it is absolutely clear that our message is particularly strong for those economies where you have, de facto or de jure inbuilt elements of indexation with all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are associated with the hump being transferred to a number of prices and to wages and salaries. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also say there was a very strong message to all price-setters and social partners. </p>
<p>And the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the real economy as we see them, stemming from a number of factors including this ongoing correction, are on the downside undoubtedly. </p>
<p>So my general advice is to have policies that are as sound as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As you say, there is a swap market that is functioning and there are a number of other observations that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> lead us to decide that it is not necessarily worth continuing. </p>
<p>These effects are not only to be found in the wage settlements -- although wage settlements are a very great, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even a dominant element. </p>
<p>The only way I would describe it is that first we discussed those different <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> and we agreed by consensus on both the decision and the message. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have very complex phenomena, including the fact that it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that a number of corporations are more inclined to be more liquid, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> to draw on their lines of credit. </p>
<p>Some are good, such as the <span class='uncertainty'>revising</span> up from 0.7% to 0.8% of growth in the third quarter, as I said earlier. </p>
<p>As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, our baseline scenario remains one of ongoing growth, but <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are clearly on the downside. </p>
<p>And I draw your attention to the fact that, from this standpoint, our two-pillar strategy <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me particularly pertinent, because we are in precisely a situation where the most important issue is what exactly is the influence of the financial sector on the real economy, and what are the dynamics behind it? </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have a phenomenon of re-intermediation, even if we are not sure that it is visible in those figures. </p>
<p>So, the debate, the discussion we had was on the pros and cons of two <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> and not three <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>. </p>
<p>On the impact on the real economy of the significant market correction that we are observing, I would say that it 's an ongoing process which has been envisaged for a long time as being <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> unavoidable and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> also in many respects a necessary correction. </p>
<p>In this respect the subtle changes that you noticed in the comments of the Governing Council are due not only to the emerging markets themselves but also to the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are associated with the developments in the industrialised world and the United States in particular. </p>
<p>But, in this particular case, taking into account the fact that some tensions remain, as well as the fact that the opening up of the market in New York <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a little bit under strain owing to demands and requests coming from European banks, we think it is a right way to cooperate in the month of January. </p>
<p>All I can say is that we have had some kind of first hint, but I am very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent because we do not have the survey itself yet, although we have some <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> sentiments which were given and which <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to confirm that there is an ongoing increase in the net tightening of credit, I would say, both for loans to enterprises and for housing loans to households. </p>
<p>Having taken everything into account and having talked to Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, it <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> that it was useful for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>But we have no particular message in this respect apart from saying that it is in the interest of all countries concerned to have the soundest and wisest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> policy both on the fiscal side and the monetary side. </p>
<p>That was the very <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span>, provisional information we were given this morning. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-02-07</b>, 45 sentences</p></div><p>You know that our main message is that we do not want second-round effects, and when we say second-round effects, we are addressing two major <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> destabilisations. </p>
<p>We also have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>, when things are run correctly in good times of the automatic stabilisers able to function. </p>
<p>I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that I am in line with what is presently being said by a large number of observers and public and private institutions. </p>
<p>And we measure very carefully by all means -- and they are numerous -- the anchoring of inflation expectations, which we consider to be absolutely essential not only in order to deliver price stability in the medium run, but also in order to contribute to the calming down of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, and I have said that many times. </p>
<p>When we had to cope with the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> we utilised the concepts and the instruments that had been decided at the very beginning and we did not invent any new tools or any new instruments. </p>
<p>I would only mention that we said -- and I said on behalf of the Governing Council at the last press conference -- that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we were perceiving were on the downside. </p>
<p>And if you compare the introductory statement with that presented at the previous press conference, you will see we insisted much more on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> which were mentioned in the important paragraph at the very beginning of the introductory statement. </p>
<p>So what has been observed -- and I do n't want to speak for all the central banks, but I think that on the other side of the Atlantic you would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> observe more or less the same evolution in the turbulent episode which started in August and that we still are experiencing -- I would say is that Treasuries were less utilised by banks as collateral, and other paper, including private paper, were more utilised. </p>
<p>On the first question: again, what the Governing Council says today by my voice is that we remain committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the medium term. </p>
<p>And we are in a universe where it would be very naive to claim that you knew in advance everything that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, if we have been exceptionally successful to date in the anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability, and we have been exceptionally successful in achieving very low <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in these inflation expectations in the medium and long run, it has been precisely because we have been constantly alert, and observers, market participants and economic agents have known that we were constantly alert. </p>
<p>Other central bankers have changed their rules because they had, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, fewer instruments and fewer tools available than they would have liked, taking into account their own traditional practices. </p>
<p>Again, <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> for us lies in the fact that, at the moment of the decision of the Governing Council, surprises have been extremely rare -- and that will certainly continue in my opinion. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have new developments in this ongoing turbulent episode. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have bad or good surprises coming from the rest of the world. </p>
<p>I would say that it is close to potential, but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> at the lower end of growth potential. </p>
<p>My understanding is that, in taking the decision it has taken, the Fed has considered the evolution of the various parameters, including the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a strong slowdown of economic activity, and the alleviation of inflationary pressures that would be associated with this strong slowdown of the US economy. </p>
<p>We will see what our staff will <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the insurers again, you remember we always considered in this press conference that what we were observing was an ongoing market correction with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> and episodes of high levels of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and that it was an ongoing correction across a very large array of different markets. </p>
<p>The Financial Stability Forum itself is the pool of a large number of workshops and committees that are working very actively to draw the lessons from the present episode of financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>So I will only say that in the months to come, which will be characterised by a very high level -- an <span class='uncertainty'>unusually</span> high level -- of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, we will continue to do all that is necessary in order to deliver price stability in the medium term and solidly anchor inflation expectations. </p>
<p>And we will see what happens and what we have today is that China, India and the Asian countries continue to have very significant dynamism, and the offsetting of the US slowdown <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be partially or more than partially be done by Asia. </p>
<p>But again, <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> does not mean that we will pre-commit in the medium run. </p>
<p>So, again, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that the Governing Council is very firm on that and it calls for all countries to strictly implement the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>But, as you know, under the present Basel II Agreement there is certainly always a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for the banking surveillance authority to augment the capital requirement -- according to Pillar 2 -- on top of what would be <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> by Pillar 1, which is the computation of the appropriate capital requirement -- whether you use a sophisticated methodology or a more standard methodology. </p>
<p>So, it 's a good methodology -- that does not exclude that if it is impossible for the private sector to deliver, or if the delivery is not convincing or if, again, it is impossible to have a consensus of the market participants and of the private sector entities, then, of course, it is always <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and in some cases, very important and useful, to embark on regulation, that 's clear. </p>
<p>Now, of course, regulations themselves, which exist in terms of banking prudentials, of insurance prudentials, of market prudentials and market surveillance and so forth, have to be permanently updated and upgraded themselves, and we did that after the Asian crisis, we certainly have to do that taking into account the present <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> and it is a work in progress., So, again, we have to progress on a very large front, the rules and regulations have to be improved to be up to date with our observations. </p>
<p>It is clear that all elements that we have in mind are confirming that the downside evolution of the real economy in the US is likely even if we have to be totally pragmatic and <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on facts and figurs. </p>
<p>There is a good criteria, which is to see exactly what you do in terms of anchoring medium term inflationary expectations, and from that standpoint it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that our own results are solid. </p>
<p>So I do not exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that some changes will be proposed in order to be less procyclical. </p>
<p>So, what I said today on behalf of the Governing Council is that incoming data have confirmed that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. </p>
<p>I would say, however, that the information and data we have -- including those data which are, I would say, less flattering than had <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> been expected -- certainly confirm that growth is ongoing. </p>
<p>On your first remark I must confess that central banks are used to hearing that from time to time and, if I measured the level of decibels on behind the curve and ahead of the curve and so forth, I would say that, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> on this side of the Atlantic, we had slightly fewer decibels than what I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> observe on the other side. </p>
<p>We have utilised this methodology recently in the domain of the sovereign <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to prevent or tackle a crisis, e.g. we have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of debt <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> scheduling and so forth, and it worked well and we have principles that are agreed upon by a very large number of countries and private sector participants. </p>
<p>I think that those who were speaking of decoupling had in mind that you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have simultaneously in the world for instance a business cycle which would be very much on the downside in the United States and a business cycle which would continue to be on the upside in the emerging world, particularly in emerging Asia., But that in my opinion does n't mean decoupling because it 's clear that, all things being equal, if the US had not gone down quite strongly, then of course the emerging Asia would have gone up even more. </p>
<p>As regards your second question as you know, because we published it -- and we were very prompt to publish it because we wanted to have this bank lending survey as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- we observed that there was a tightening of credit conditions. </p>
<p>If we were all in Europe behaving as properly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> according to the rules, then the functioning of the automatic stabilisers would be very substantial. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember it 's the additional long-term refinancing that we had decided on last year that were of the level of $ 60 billion each and we are renewing those operations. </p>
<p>In line with the diagnosis that we made a long time ago, before the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> and that I reported to you concerning the fact that we had in a large array of different markets an underpricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, a level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, a level of spreads, a level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia, which were too low. </p>
<p>As regards the money market evolution it is true, and we are very satisfied with this on both sides of the Atlantic, that the tensions, as far as we measured them, have undoubtedly diminished and, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the measure, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that they progressively came down from a very high level and now we are -- as regards the spread between the three-month rate and the overnight rate in three months ' time, which is a good measure, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, of the tension -- we are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> around 40 basis points now. </p>
<p>It does n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be directly associated with the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, so for the present moment what we have in front of us, which calls as I said for further analysis -- very deep analysis, are data that are not reflecting what we have observed since June/July and certainly August, which was the start of the turbulent episode on the financial markets and credit market. </p>
<p>But, in any case, you always have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>, on the basis of an assessment made by the surveillance authority, to increase the capital requirements. </p>
<p>If, at any time, it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that it is opportune to reactivate such a concept, we will do it, but at this stage it looked unnecessary, both for us and for the Swiss National Bank. </p>
<p>I said that incoming data that we had, even if mixed in some domains -- we had data that were more positive than expected by economists, including the Ifo institute for instance, or data as regards industrial production that on a month to month basis <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be better than expected -- but if I take all the data and all the surveys that have been made, I would say that they confirm that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> lie on the downside. </p>
<p>What is clear, in my opinion, is that we have -- through the banking prudentials as well as through all other <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> grids -- to look at what is procyclical in the present set of rules and behaviour and try to avoid procyclicality, because one of the lessons of the present observations is that there is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a tendency for parts of global finance to be much too procyclical. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-03-06</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the current monetary pol icy stance will contribute to the achievement of this objective. </p>
<p>There is absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we must be faithful to our mandate, and our mandate is clear. </p>
<p>As regards the present monetary policy stance we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it will contribute to achieving this objective. </p>
<p>However, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we can see the effect of supply and demand and the encountering of supply and demand, as well as the effect of fairly high levels of cartelisation in the various markets. </p>
<p>But I have already mentioned that we have a number of cartels that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> explain why these evolutions <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be as symmetrical. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is considered by a number of other institutions and our own staff to be appropriate, but we do not endorse that ourselves. </p>
<p>If need be, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly continue with such cooperation, but at the moment I have nothing else to say on that. </p>
<p>I have already said - <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> your remark - that our 320 million fellow citizens are asking us to be faithful to our mandate. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that a number of observers, including market participants, often forget that we have a mandate, and that this mandate is clear. </p>
<p>On your last point, I said already that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to the achievement of our objective. </p>
<p>We have a lot of parameters, and those together concur to influence inflation and price stability -- <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> -- and that is, again, the needle of our compass. </p>
<p>So, we are in a situation which is, as always, multi-dimensional, but which is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unusually</span> multi-dimensional. </p>
<p>I am certainly sticking to what we agreed upon at a global level, at the level of the G7 in particular, i.e., that excessive movements, excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> are undesirable for global growth. </p>
<p>Oil is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> of a different nature. </p>
<p>As regards the other <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> you know that they are based on <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> related to the price of oil, the price of food and of other commodities. </p>
<p>You can deduce from that what you <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> would be the right understanding from your standpoint. </p>
<p>Since 1 January 1999 we have had the same collateral policy, which we have not changed, and we are certainly eager to have the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> collateral checking at all times. </p>
<p>That said we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the present monetary stance is precisely in line with this objective. </p>
<p>That said, as we intended from the outset, we are very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and take pains to have the best collateral fully in line with our initial, unchanged concept. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we have proved in the past that we were able to do whatever was necessary to deliver price stability, including in two periods in particular. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that our monetary policy stance at the time was in line with the delivery of price stability. </p>
<p>We have been lucky enough to have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of 3-months refinancing since the very beginning, which was not the case on the other side of the Atlantic or over the Channel. </p>
<p>These projections are based on an <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> which is of technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. </p>
<p>And again, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective of medium-term price stability and solidly anchoring inflation expectations. </p>
<p>There are other elements that we also have to take into consideration, elements that are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> associated with differences in various bonds liquidity, as well as the across-the-board correction that we see in spreads in financial markets in general. </p>
<p>Concerning the impact of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, I will say again that we are living in a multi-dimensional world. </p>
<p>Answering your second question the sentence speaks for itself as regards the fact that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. </p>
<p>I think that it is too early to draw definitive conclusions from this observation, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be made in respect of a very large area of markets, certainly treasuries, as you just said, but also, private paper, across the board. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-04-10</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>As regards the bank lending survey, we have no <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span> of what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see in the future. </p>
<p>And if we were to restart this exercise at the level of staff at the moment, the figures would not <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be exactly the same, because a number of factors would have to be taken into account: parameters would have changed in a number of directions. </p>
<p>And those projections incorporate a large element of range, because we consider that we are in a universe which remains <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>That being said, I remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>On the UK, I would only say that excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is not welcome for any of us and I guess that it is not welcome for the United Kingdom, as it is not welcome for us. </p>
<p>When we take a snapshot of the situation today in the US, state by state, and in the euro area, country by country, I would say that we have <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> the same standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> of inflation and of rate of growth. </p>
<p>That is a reflection of the fact that the market itself, in its own functioning -- at least if you consider that this is a pertinent indicator -- was thinking that it was not only a short-term episode but, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, a longer-term episode -- an ongoing process which would take more time. </p>
<p>We know that we are living in a world which is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>With regard to the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, you know that we have always said that it was a very significant market correction, with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> and a very high level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and that it was ongoing. </p>
<p>As I mentioned in the Introductory Statement, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is there. </p>
<p>But it is also equally important to be pretty conscious that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also have in front of us very difficult challenges, and we have to be alert. </p>
<p>I never said that because we did not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that. </p>
<p>After the end of last year, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that the hump had disappeared. </p>
<p>I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we will take any new decisions at this stage. </p>
<p>I gave you one explanation, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> we have other explanations. </p>
<p>We remain permanently alert because all <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our own credibility and on the solid anchoring of inflationary expectations, because the price-setters today take into account what they expect to be inflation in the medium run after this hump has progressively disappeared. </p>
<p>As regards your point on the exchange rate, let me say again -- because I would not like you to interpret my silence on the exchange rate -- that I deplore the excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of exchange rates. </p>
<p>We live in a world where wisdom based on experience, the accumulation of experiences is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> more important than ever. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me very normal, in the present situation that the banks are more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, more attentive, they look at the credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> with great caution and, so, I am not surprised at all by the response that we are receiving from the banks. </p>
<p>It is true that it looks to be very much less acute and significant in comparison with what we observed <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> twenty years ago, or even <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> ten years ago. </p>
<p>In a way there has been another sort of coordinated action because when I look at what has been done by other sister central banks, I see that they have very much improved their own set of tools and instruments in order to be as able as we have been since the very beginning to cope with the <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> tensions and <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> challenges that we all have had to cope with. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> started in August last year and we still see this continued dynamism. </p>
<p>So there is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a certain degree of substitution. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be that they are embarking less on issuing instruments like bonds and commercial papers and have less access to stock issuance, and prefer to draw from banking loans. </p>
<p>But since the very beginning we did n't <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it would be an episode that would not last -- we said it 's an" ongoing process ''. </p>
<p>We have to deliver price stability, and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> -- not only in Europe but in a large part of the world -- that by delivering price stability and being credible in the delivery of price stability we not only deliver price stability but also create the conditions for job creation, for sustainable growth and, particularly in this period of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, also to calm down the financial markets by solidly anchoring the inflationary expectations that are embedded in medium and long-term market interest rates. </p>
<p>This is a matter for reflection and meditation, but as you <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, I am not particularly eloquent on the exchange rates. </p>
<p>I really <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that as regards the functioning of the money market it 's very important that the central banks remain in close contact, as they are. </p>
<p>On the first question, taking into account the diagnosis that we made even before the start of the turbulent episode it was clear that an important market correction was both unavoidable and necessary because we had, before the turbulent episode, an under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in general in global finance that was documented. </p>
<p>Of course, I do not exclude any further decision that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take when the time comes: we will follow the situation <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span>, but at this stage, there are absolutely no such intentions. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> come from the fact that a number of firms want to be as liquid as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and so are drawing from their credit lines, standby credit, confirmed credit. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-05-08</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>If my memory serves me correctly, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a net tightening of 49% in the first quarter of this year instead of 41% in the last quarter of last year. </p>
<p>So what is important -- and what I 'm saying is very much in line with what was said earlier on by President Trichet and Governor Garganas -- is the pursuit of policies that will strengthen competitiveness, which, as you <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, first of all involves further structural reforms in order to foster higher productivity growth and strengthen competition in markets. </p>
<p>I have said what I had to say: it is clear that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the present monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain the dynamism of the loans. </p>
<p>As I said on behalf of the Governing Council, and I also said that last time, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. </p>
<p>And this is largely due to the fact that the first quarter <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be resilient, which, whatever the slowing down of growth in the second semester is, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> permit us to have an average rate of growth for 2008 which again is very much, in the view of observers, public and private, in line with what we had said previously. </p>
<p>On the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, this process of market correction of great amplitude, with episodes of high levels of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, episodes of very high levels of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> and elements of overshooting that we see in a number of markets is an ongoing phenomenon. </p>
<p>At this stage all I would say for the present year is that the average growth which is projected by the international institutions -- and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take a number of them, including the OECD -- and by the private sector -- would be reasonably close to what our own staff published in the last projections. </p>
<p>And again I have to say that it is important because not only is it our mandate, not only is it what the people of Europe are calling upon us to do, but it is also very important in the present <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> that we are experiencing in the financial markets. </p>
<p>We are observing elements that are in some respects encouraging and <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to show that a number of markets are going progressively back to normal, or closer to what would be normal functioning, but it is not the case for all the markets concerned. </p>
<p>You have noticed for instance that the services sector PMI was a little bit better than <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> in April, that the European Commission 's service confidence indicator was a little bit less flattering than <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, and that consumer confidence in March was unchanged. </p>
<p>But I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> what our staff will present next time. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have other explanations. </p>
<p>If we were to follow the line you are implicitly <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span>, we would ourselves unanchor all inflation expectations. </p>
<p>A solid anchoring of inflation expectations permits additional <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in medium and long-term market interest rates to be avoided. </p>
<p>Then there would be, on top of the arithmetic augmentation of inflation expectations, additional <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia: market participants would think that if one changes the definition of price stability once, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> change it again, so there would be no protection against future changes. </p>
<p>And avoiding such <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in this component of European finance is important in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>We can make a clear distinction between those economies which recognised that prices had changed -- and that had to be recognised and accepted -- and those who thought that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> protect their economies from the real transfer: the second had very poor results in comparison with the first. </p>
<p>But the influence of these factors <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decline over time, and were this to happen, the adverse effects of the external imbalances on activity and employment would be felt more. </p>
<p>I have been criticised for that because people <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a wage freeze or a cut in wages -- we do not. </p>
<p>From the financial markets we have also indications that the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the break-even has been quite substantial when you extract for example the five-year break-even, the ten-year break-even and the five-year in five years ' time. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, because this report is in Greek and I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that you did not read it, I will give you an outline of what our views are there and my views in particular. </p>
<p>Again, I do n't draw a lot of consequences from what we are observing from one month to the other ; we have <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and we have to remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>And of course, and this is another issue on which my views are well known, in this country at any rate, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that public finance in this country should have sufficient room for manoeuvre in order to better cope with expected substantial increases in age-related expenditure, because Greece is faced with one of the worst problems of an ageing population, which will have serious consequences for both healthcare and pension system expenditure. </p>
<p>This is a standard position of the Governing Council, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so Mr President, and of the Bank of Greece all these years. </p>
<p>I do n't know why you say that we have a different view of the inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, and inflation as it is materialising, from last time. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span>, some people are simultaneously asking for more price stability and a more accommodative monetary policy, because they are not called on to be coherent necessarily. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> see a number of judgements on what we are doing here and there. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> labour moderation ; we <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that labour cost developments should take into account productivity growth, labour market conditions and developments in competitor countries. </p>
<p>The cumulative loss of competitiveness over several years is reflected in the widening of the current account deficit, which has reached very high levels as a percentage of GDP and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be sustainable. </p>
<p>We are very clear on what is our mandate, the fact that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the present monetary policy stance will permit us to achieve our objective and, that being said, we are constantly alert, as everybody will understand. </p>
<p>The addition of the change of definition of price stability and the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia would immediately trigger a significant augmentation of medium and long-term market interest rates. </p>
<p>This is clear, and if you look at the market participants, observers, investors, savers the world over, they have absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we are independent. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-06-05</b>, 37 sentences</p></div><p>And the lesson of the first oil shock was precisely that because there were a number of <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span> errors in the diagnosis of the situation, in Europe you can date from the first oil shock the start of much lower growth and mass unemployment. </p>
<p>That is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>We have a number of sectors in which we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have abnormal price setting -- and particularly those sectors where you do not have the level of competition that would permit the avoidance of such behaviour. </p>
<p>I do n't say it is certain, I say it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Again, we decide when we have to decide, we take, as you know, at any moment the decision we judge as appropriate to counter inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>We will examine the situation very carefully and we will, in our next meeting, not exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of increasing rates by a small amount. </p>
<p>It is not certain ; it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Our position, I said it in the introductory remarks, is that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability have further increased. </p>
<p>And we have not changed anything since the beginning of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the staff projections the figures are the figures, and we have in front of us the figures that are the projections of our Eurosystem staff -- not only the ECB staff but the whole of the Eurosystem staff -- and they are, as I said, quite in line with the most recent other projections that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see. </p>
<p>It does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me that our reputation is that we are behind the curve, at least when I read various articles. </p>
<p>We consider that this framework has served us very well and, of course, we apply this collateral framework as efficiently and effectively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We look at other projections and we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> observe that the most recent surveys of other institutions, including the OECD, are very close to what our staff are saying. </p>
<p>We took into account all the information that we had ; the projections of the staff of the Eurosystem and the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability based on both the economic and the monetary analysis. </p>
<p>It would have to be carefully checked in historical terms, but it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is a" première '', this cooperation with the Federal Reserve System for delivering liquidity in dollars on this side of the Atlantic -- involving not only us, but also the Swiss National Bank -- and we are satisfied with the present way it functions. </p>
<p>I said that the projections of the Eurosystem staff are making the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we do not have broad-based second-round effects. </p>
<p>And we strongly encourage them not to embark on tax policies that would counter commodity price increases because we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be counterproductive. </p>
<p>Since the very beginning of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, we have been, and will continue to be, very keen for our money market to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and with interest rates as close as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in the short term, to our policy rates. </p>
<p>A number of us thought that, all things being taken into account, all information and analysis of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we had a case for increasing rates. </p>
<p>It would be abnormal precisely to take into account inflation today as if it was a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span> of inflation tomorrow. </p>
<p>Supply is also playing a role and there are a number of reasons to think that there are also <span class='uncertainty'>anomalies</span> of a different nature on the supply side, including <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> geo-strategic elements. </p>
<p>It is not a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span> for inflation tomorrow. </p>
<p>A good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span> of inflation tomorrow is what our definition of price stability is. </p>
<p>But, we were not in an identical situation in terms of the technological drive and the associated productivity progress that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be observed. </p>
<p>Let me only say that, as far as we are concerned at the ECB, the Governing Council considers that if we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> continue to be active in implementing these structural reforms that we all agree to, we would certainly be able to much better exploit the potential for total factor productivity increases and labour productivity increases that are made <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in particular by technology. </p>
<p>I would therefore say that one of the advantages of our present situation is that we have <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a large capacity to do much better in terms of productivity, which is one of the major goals of Europeans. </p>
<p>When I said that a number of us were <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> increases, it was for today. </p>
<p>But I have explained a number of things that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> clarify what we had said in saying that we were in a state of heightened alertness. </p>
<p>We consider that the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> is not excluded that, after having carefully examined the situation, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> decide to move our rates by a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations, taking into account the situation. </p>
<p>And again, taking stock of the collegial experience and wisdom that we have around the table -- but I was sufficiently explicit on that, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>In those two cases we were vindicated, even if the economic analysis did not necessarily <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> to do what we did. </p>
<p>That is the situation which we are in: it is not certain, it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the first question, we have had a collateral framework since the setting-up of the ECB which was more comprehensive and more complete, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, than others. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we still have a lot to do at the global level. </p>
<p>We ourselves would call for all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> measures to be taken to save energy. </p>
<p>As far as the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> is concerned, it is ongoing, with episodes of high <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and of course we have to do everything necessary at the global level and the European level, according to the orientations which have already been approved by the international community, in particular the 67 recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum, which we have approved. </p>
<p>At the moment I am speaking, we consider that our decision today was a good decision to take and we consider it 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> our duty to tell you in what state of mind we are, as regards the next meeting, but we will take our decision in the next meeting on the basis of all information we have at the moment of our decision. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-07-03</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>It is according to the analysis of all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we take our own decision. </p>
<p>We said clearly last time that it was <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> but not certain that we would increase rates today. </p>
<p>If we did not have that needle in our compass and instead had another needle, the natural consequences would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be that inflation expectations would go up. </p>
<p>No, I do n't think that this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the case. </p>
<p>I do n't underestimate that when I said clearly on behalf of the Governing Council that it was <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to increase rates today, it was considered an important message. </p>
<p>Taking everything into account, where exactly is the needle that captures the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability? </p>
<p>Others can pre-commit, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, either to go up or to go down or to stay at their level for a considerable period of time. </p>
<p>The interest rates of 50-year treasuries -- as I mentioned before -- which at the moment of speaking are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> around 4.9%, would be much higher with the unanchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Let me go back to the question you asked, because the two are closely linked: we saw from our analysis that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> had augmented and this was the reason why we took today 's decision. </p>
<p>We are solemnly telling all economic agents, corporate businesses, price-setters in the economy and social partners that the worst decision they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take would be precisely to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what we are observing today, namely this protracted period of high inflation, will last in the medium term. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what we did today and what we did before is precisely there to enable us to deliver price stability in the medium term. </p>
<p>We have <span class='uncertainty'>anomalies</span> concerning the high level of subsidies, which prevent in a number of economies - not only industrialised but also emerging market economies - the ultimate consumers from taking into account the real price of energy as it is. </p>
<p>So, we have to synthesise a large array of information, and that drives us to qualify the situation as one of moderate ongoing growth, taking into account the downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> I mentioned. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this move upward is the kind of move that was necessary to permit us to continue to tell our fellow citizens" You can have confidence that we will deliver price stability in the medium term despite the very difficult circumstances in which we are, particularly because of the very strong increase in the price of a number of commodities. '' </p>
<p>But till now it has served the euro area very well and, as you know, it was considered even at the beginning of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> as some kind of role model in some respects for central banks. </p>
<p>But I also told you that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were on the downside. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see the difference between those economies which considered that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not do anything and those which considered that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> preserve price stability in the medium term. </p>
<p>Against the present background and on the basis of our present assessment, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the monetary policy stance after today 's decision will contribute to achieving our objective of price stability. </p>
<p>We are concentrating on what <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us. </p>
<p>But if we have a supplier-driven artificial scarcity, then it is very grave and it has an impact which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be very grave at the level of the global economy. </p>
<p>As I have already mentioned with all due respect to the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are ahead of us, which I clearly pointed out, our present assessment is of a moderate, ongoing growth. </p>
<p>And let me say that we are convinced that sharp <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuations</span> between major currencies <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have implications for economic and financial stability. </p>
<p>And finally, markets have to be as transparent and as competitive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We do what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we have to do. </p>
<p>On our collateral framework, we consider that it has served us very well since the beginning of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>On the first question: again, if we have increased rates today, it is because we consider that, taking everything into account, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability had augmented and we had to counter these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>The second-round effects <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on us. </p>
<p>And I can say that the third quarter will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> not be particularly flattering either. </p>
<p>This is something which has to be as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> resolutely improved. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-08-07</b>, 38 sentences</p></div><p>So, do not <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> anything, but see it as a reminder of the terms of reference that I have for this particular issue. </p>
<p>We would be as public as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But again, the European Parliament said that they understood why we were <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> as regards the publication of minutes. </p>
<p>I try to be as transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, as you know, and we are proud that our predecessors, Wim Duisenberg and Christian Noyer, gave us -- to Lucas Papademos and me -- the concept of this interaction, because it did not exist before the setting up of the euro, as you are aware. </p>
<p>So, to conclude, I would ask the IMF to do its very important job, and I am in no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that it will continue to do the job very well. </p>
<p>We are in a universe where we see all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I have listed. </p>
<p>Our analysis is exactly the same as before, and you should not over-interpret any changes that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have noticed. </p>
<p>So, I would say, more or less the same level of tightening, but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a little less net tightening. </p>
<p>Our position is clear on the fact that we had identified <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, the fact that some of those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are materialising and the fact that we see reasons for the materialisation of those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are, as I have already indicated, the slowdown of the global economy in particular, and the drain on our economy as a result of the development of the commodity, oil and food prices. </p>
<p>As regards inflation, once again, we have only one needle in our compass and we take absolutely all information that is pertinent into consideration to identify the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of inflation in the months and years to come. </p>
<p>So, the fact that some of the survey data are very weak was for us the materialisation of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we had identified and made public. </p>
<p>We knew that there were <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are materialising. </p>
<p>I told you last time -- and I will stick to that -- that we consider that our collateral framework has served us pretty well since the beginning of this <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>At the present moment I would say that what we have seen is that as regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have listed as the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth in the euro area -- I did that last time on behalf of the Governing Council, and also in the month before -- there is some materialisation of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that were identified. </p>
<p>What I can tell you at this stage is that we have seen a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> lower net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase, but a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> greater net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households, although starting from a lower level. </p>
<p>We have, if everything is taken into account, a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> lower net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises than that observed in the first quarter. </p>
<p>They ask us to be as transparent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> ; they ask, in particular, that, in this candid exchange that we have, we be even more transparent. </p>
<p>As regards the number of surveys that have come in and that we took note of, I would not say that we were surprised because we had already identified the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and we had said clearly that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we had listed were on the downside. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that, at the current juncture, we are in a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> different universe to that of ten or even five years ago. </p>
<p>And we are not making any difference between this particular price, which is wages and salaries, and the other prices, where we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> judge that there is not sufficient competition between the firms and where some price-setting is abnormal. </p>
<p>We have the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of second-round effects and the absolute necessity to avoid the materialisation of such <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that a number of effects in this respect are not taken into account by part of the analysis which is being done. </p>
<p>First of all, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the IMF was <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> in mentioning this. </p>
<p>On your third question, which was on the wage and salary negotiations in particular, again, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have noted that when we are speaking, on behalf of the Governing Council, of wages and salary increases, we also mention the price-setting issue. </p>
<p>I would stick to what I have always said, namely that it 's an ongoing, very important market correction with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> and high levels of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and that it is absolutely no time for complacency. </p>
<p>We see a pipeline effect in a number of other prices stemming from increases in the prices of inputs -- particularly commodities -- and that is something which is ongoing and undoubtedly creates more <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And, I would say as candidly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, we have no bias. </p>
<p>We are entirely pragmatic, and <span class='uncertainty'>predictions</span> of the future prices of commodities are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most difficult exercise you can imagine. </p>
<p>So, these were the various elements which allowed us to cope with this <span class='uncertainty'>unpredictable</span> situation from the outset. </p>
<p>I think" high and <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> '' is a good description, a good way to capture things in the present situation. </p>
<p>Everything that we have observed as regards inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> has fully justified what we have done. </p>
<p>I have mentioned on a number of occasions, on behalf of the Governing Council, that the price of oil -- and not only of oil, also of food -- was high and <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>We took decisions which were in line with the analysis that we were facing an important market correction with episodes of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>They are exactly the same kinds of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that were listed before. </p>
<p>The Eurosystem has always been very alert in following everything that has happened as efficiently as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We never considered that there was a" quick fix '' that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> allow us to resolve that situation, and everything that has happened since then has proved that our analysis was right. </p>
<p>I would say that" <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> '' captures pretty well the evolution that we have seen in the most recent period. </p>
<p>In a way, we were <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more prepared for the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> than some others, because we had also the capacity to accept private paper as collateral, the primary difference between us and a number of other institutions. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-09-04</b>, 44 sentences</p></div><p>We have upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability -- we are clear on that. </p>
<p>As regards oil prices, we are in a situation which is really a universe of great <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, as one sees. </p>
<p>Many colleagues <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> make remarks that are very useful, very interesting and stimulating, and also very adapted to the environment in which they find themselves. </p>
<p>It is complex because it incorporates <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia on top of inflation expectations, and you know that analysts are working a lot to try to disentangle the information on <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and on inflation expectations which are contained in this break-even concept. </p>
<p>Indeed, I think it is important that what we communicate is adapted as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to various circumstances. </p>
<p>What I can say on these measures is that they were designed to refine particular elements of our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control framework. </p>
<p>And the dynamism of M3 is partly due to the fact that this yield curve is flat and that a large proportion of investors are not taking the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to be longer. </p>
<p>On the ECB 's collateral framework, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> reserve your question until later because we have a decision to announce today, which I will do at the end of the press conference. </p>
<p>I have noted with extreme attention that the US authorities have said that a strong dollar was in the interests of the United States of America, and I see that this declaration is <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> by a number of operators and market participants. </p>
<p>As regards the judgment of the Governing Council, I will sum it up in saying that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we see are exactly what we saw at the last meeting and they are on the upside. </p>
<p>We only want to be sure that we are optimising the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management of this collateral. </p>
<p>No, I would say that we have a biennial review and that we have considered since the very beginning of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> that we have no reason to change our framework, so we did not. </p>
<p>So we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not observe on this side of the Atlantic the same kind of developments that are observed on the other side. </p>
<p>The kind of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that we are seeing on the oil and commodity markets is exceptional. </p>
<p>We did that with a view to optimising our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control. </p>
<p>This was what I wanted to tell you as regards the biennial review of he <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control measures. </p>
<p>It is something which must be significant, but we have no position of the Governing Council on a new <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> level of growth potential. </p>
<p>But I would say that we have been reasoning very much on the basis of our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control and with a view to optimising our own <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control. </p>
<p>As you know, we have a way of reviewing our framework every two years, and the previous reviews were reflected in the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> control framework and the General Documentation that we published in 2004 and 2006. </p>
<p>And I have to say that -- and this is the reason why we are not changing the structure of our framework -- we consider that it has served us very well, particularly since the beginning of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>And I will again echo what is said by the US authorities themselves, which I have always considered to be very important, even at a time when <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> market participants were less attentive to what was said. </p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons why I said that we do n't see as yet a significant correction of these dynamics that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be interpreted as associated with the financial turmoil. </p>
<p>We considered that we were in our sentiment in the Governing Council not exactly at the optimum with the system which was set up two years ago, long before the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>So, again, it 's true for the staff projections of the ECB as well as for all projections: they are highly <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore, I would only say at this stage that, even with the recent slowdown in the price of oil, there is still the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of new spikes, which I hope will not be observed as it would be very bad for the global economy, for inflation and for all parties concerned. </p>
<p>On growth potential, it is a pertinent remark of economists that when you have a big change in relative prices, as it is the case, there are a number of phenomena that <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span>, including the fact that part of the stock of capital becomes, for various reasons, partly obsolescent, and then you undoubtedly have a shock to growth potential. </p>
<p>We do what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is necessary at any time, and we have proved that in the past, including in the very recent past. </p>
<p>I would say at this stage that what we have observed in the banking sector until now -- and I am prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> -- does not signal that we have a banking sector which is, at this moment in time, hampered by its level of capitalisation. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that market participants or traders or investors can make, I leave to them the responsibility of their <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>However, as regards the position of the Governing Council, I <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that you follow what I say on behalf of the Governing Council, of course. </p>
<p>I accept that this methodology is theoretical, and, in a universe that is extraordinarily <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>, we have to recognise the fact that it is highly theoretical, but we do not have any other means to be objective in trying to take into account the future. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be one of the additional reasons why we are observing such hectic behaviour on commodities markets. </p>
<p>Particularly when you look at the differential between the three-month deposits and the overnight swap interest rates, you clearly see that we still have an <span class='uncertainty'>anomaly</span> at least in comparison with what was the case in major markets before the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>I therefore urge them to be as responsible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> because there is a common interest in the global economy. </p>
<p>We also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the decision we took two months ago and therefore the present monetary policy stance will contribute to delivering price stability in the medium term. </p>
<p>We see as regards the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that they are on the upside. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, we are very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent in this respect. </p>
<p>For this reason, we think it is important to have that in mind, even if I was very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent, as you can see in terms of the assessment of the quantity of the figures. </p>
<p>As regards your question why we do not have any bias, we have just increased interest rates and we increased them precisely to be sure that, taking into account the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we see, we can cope with those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, offsetting them as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Again, I 'm happy that our collateral framework <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> to be adapted to new circumstances that were extraordinarily demanding for all of us, and this was absolutely clear across the Atlantic, across the Channel. </p>
<p>But we should not neglect the fact that there are also all the elements that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> characterise a cartel. </p>
<p>The question of supply is therefore an open question which is also extremely important and <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been more important in the recent period, marked by the spike in oil prices. </p>
<p>Had we reasoned as you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>, then we would have immediately said we are in a period of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, all <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are augmenting, we have to change immediately. </p>
<p>We took it seriously from the very first day, as you know, and our judgement <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> to be right in this respect, i.e. that it was a very serious and very significant market correction that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> last. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-10-02</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>But for economic agents and market participants, it is also extremely important that we continue to be the solid anchor of expectations, because we then diminish the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the financial markets. </p>
<p>As regards your first question, I commented that I would attribute <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> to the wisdom and lucidity of observers, but I never comment on immediate reactions that the introductory statement <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> trigger in the market. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of having close cooperation with the other central banks, be aware of the fact that when we do something, it is on the basis of our assessment of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>It would introduce <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in all market interest rates: It would be very bad for financial stability, as well as for price stability. </p>
<p>We see that we have <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> regained control of inflation expectations in a fashion which is now visible. </p>
<p>I expect that it will, overall, permit the authorities that will meet to exchange views in circumstances that are <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>, to compare notes and to see how they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be enlightened by the conversation with others. </p>
<p>But I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go on and on and give praise to all governments in Europe ! </p>
<p>And in a period when it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that the situation calls for government responsibility, I confirm that we judge it appropriate that governments take up their responsibilities. </p>
<p>Our decisions on the monetary policy stance are based upon our assessment of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Market participants were underpricing <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> before the financial turmoil, and we said that publicly. </p>
<p>And I said that we were today seeing that there was some reduction in the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability but that we still had upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>The times are demanding, as I said, the situation is demanding and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>, and of course in such circumstances it is important that all of the private sector as well as the public sector, that all authorities live up to their responsibilities. </p>
<p>I will only say that what we have observed since the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> began in August last year has been a remarkable resilience of the emerging economies. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the evolution of growth, I draw your attention to the fact that I have been saying for a very long time that growth would be very weak, i.e. there would be a trough in the second and third quarters, and that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth are on the downside. </p>
<p>We are in a situation where, collectively, the banks have a tendency, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span>, to over-assess the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that they are taking in engaging in loans with other commercial banks. </p>
<p>We are having an exceptional meeting in the context of this exceptionally high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that we are presently experiencing. </p>
<p>On your first question as regards the wording of the introductory statement, let me repeat that we are in a situation of an exceptionally high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>The situation is clearly absolutely exceptional in terms of the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and, as I have already said, as always we are totally free to do at any time what we judge to be necessary to take into account the evolution of the situation in terms of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>We are observing a slowdown in the euro area economy and I said that this has contributed to alleviating <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>We have never hidden the fact that there were downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth after the trough observed in the second and third quarters of this year. </p>
<p>In the judgement of the Governing Council, we have both the intensification of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, which creates a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that we have to consider, and we have the weakening of growth. </p>
<p>Again, I confirm that our judgement is that there is a visible weakening of economic activity and that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for future growth are on the downside. </p>
<p>We have seen a reduction in the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation but, in the judgement of the Governing Council, while they have diminished, they have not disappeared. </p>
<p>On your first question, I will repeat that we are in a situation of an exceptionally high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and we are free to do at any time what is necessary. </p>
<p>As I have said several times on behalf of the Governing Council, there is currently an extraordinarily high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>I would also say that we are living in a situation which is exceptional, where there is a very high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>This, of course, <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our judgement of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, as well as the evolution of the situation that influences the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>We can not do otherwise, because if we were acting in a different scheme, in a different concept, then we would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> to those lucid observers and market participants that have been mentioned that they can unanchor our inflation expectations, because we would be introducing other considerations than this solid anchoring of inflation expectations which is based on our determination to deliver price stability in the medium term. </p>
<p>At the present moment, we have seen the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> diminishing but not eliminated. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>predictability</span> is to be attributed to the extreme acuteness and lucidity of the observers. </p>
<p>It is the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>It is therefore clear today that some of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that were clearly highlighted in previous messages from the Governing Council in the previous months have materialised. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-11-06</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>The facts and figures that the Governing Council has do not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a decrease in nominal values, which is the mark of deflation. </p>
<p>It means an additional effort, in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> taken by Governments. </p>
<p>Our position is that we try to do exactly what is needed at any moment in time, without being hampered by pre-commitments that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually prevent us from doing whatever <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be necessary. </p>
<p>As regards your third question on <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> we are observing on the exchange market -- not only for us, but for all, absolutely all, currencies -- a considerable level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, which reflects the tensions in question. </p>
<p>Clearly you have the phenomenon of repatriation of capital in the place where they are managed, and this is creating considerable <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the Brussels meeting, everybody knows what is at stake and what we need to concentrate on as regards the present financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>This is my working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> at this stage, but I 'm not ruling anything out ! </p>
<p>I am not thinking of any particular economy, but I think that, among the lessons to be drawn from the present episode in global finance and the global economy, we have to take into account the need to introduce -- through different means, a new framework, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> peer surveillance, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> other means -- a way of avoiding the persistence of very large imbalances, both domestic and external. </p>
<p>I am not <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that the fine-tuning of the present situation through fiscal stimulus would be part of it. </p>
<p>How do you reintroduce a level of discipline which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> indispensable in order to avoid problems at a global level? </p>
<p>This is the first time that we have had a very large episode of financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in the industrialised world itself, at the heart of the industrialised world, and we are particularly attentive to that. </p>
<p>There we had to see how to organise -- or not -- the rescheduling of their debt, because they had defaulted <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the qualification of the conditionality that they were embarking on with the help of the IMF. </p>
<p>And these should be seen for what they are, namely decisions that increase the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the governments themselves and therefore decrease the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the banks. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> the encouragement -- the strong encouragement -- that I mentioned earlier will work. </p>
<p>It is clear that, increasingly, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the" vintage '' of the projections, indications from all private and public entities are that after the very recent intensification of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, in particular since mid-September, which marked a new episode in the intensification of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, the impact on the real economy is more and more important. </p>
<p>That being said I am very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because, as I said, since mid-September we have had a very significant intensification of tensions associated, in particular but not exclusively, with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. </p>
<p>What is important is that we were unanimous in considering that the alleviation of upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability was sufficiently clear to permit us, for the second time in less than one month, to substantially reduce interest rates. </p>
<p>I would say that this is work in progress, and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that a lot of directions have already been identified as being the right ones for the financial market. </p>
<p>I accept that it takes time to realise that you are in a very different new environment, and I also understand that there is a certain asymmetry between the decisions that you take to toughen considerably your <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management and the decisions that you take to get back to a more normal position. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we are all doing what is required in the circumstances, which are exceptionally tense, exceptionally <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> and challenging. </p>
<p>I think it is important that we take up our own responsibilities, and that all observers see us doing so, and that we do n't hesitate to do things that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not necessarily have done before. </p>
<p>With regard to your first question, the Governing Council was unanimous in thinking that a significant decrease in rates was appropriate in the present circumstances, where we see an alleviation of the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>And the fact that I am able to say, on behalf of the Governing Council, that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have the headline inflation in line with our definition of price stability next year is something which is very important, for the confidence of our fellow citizens. </p>
<p>I do not exclude that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> decrease rates again. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the projections, we will publish our staff projections and discuss the projections in general at our next decision-making meeting in Brussels, and all what I would confirm is that the main difference that can be seen in all the various projections at the moment -- I am talking about all the projections ; we do not stick exclusively to our staff projections ourselves -- both in the private and public sector - is that the projections, as far as real economic growth is concerned, are more and more going down, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the vintage. </p>
<p>Negative figures for growth in 2009 are gradually <span class='uncertainty'>appearing</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> some people mentioned the figure" 25 '' at a certain moment, but the two main options were 50 and 75 basis points, with the substantial difference being that, ultimately, taking everything into account, we were unanimous in judging that 50 basis points was appropriate in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>From the last figures that I have given you can substract an element of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia that would give you a break even which would be very much in line with our definition of price stability over the medium term. </p>
<p>So, a very significant reduction, and that is part of the overall sentiment that we have that not only upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability have been alleviated but there has also been a significant regaining of control of inflation expectations, which is very important. </p>
<p>All in all, the decision to cut the interest rate by 50 basis points <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be the right and appropriate one. </p>
<p>Future decisions will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on our own judgment based on facts, figures and data. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2008-12-04</b>, 39 sentences</p></div><p>This is something which is complex, which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> incorporate elements such as increased drawing on previously agreed credit lines, a number of phenomena relating to decisions already taken, or the use of loans to replace securities, which are enormously difficult to issue now because of the illiquidity of a number of markets. </p>
<p>One should not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> these two concepts, as some <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to do. </p>
<p>Disinflation is of a different nature, it means that you have headline inflation that is going down, including, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, into the negative zone exceptionally, but that does not mean that the inflation expectations themselves are unanchored on the low side. </p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that the futures market is a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictor</span>. </p>
<p>So, everything that permits this market to function as smoothly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> is welcome. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, I will not comment in any respect on what the market is <span class='uncertainty'>predicting</span> at a certain distance from now. </p>
<p>So, you are right to underline that we are clearly in circumstances where, in our eyes, there has been a very considerable decrease in the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability in a very short space of time, and that is why we have taken these decisions. </p>
<p>And we call on them to take fully into account all that has been decided already, which will be implemented as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> by authorities. </p>
<p>We have to work on that and we have to be sure that what we are doing is really effective, and that is the reason why I insisted on the fact that the decisions that have been taken -- not only by us but also by governments -- have to be implemented as quickly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, including the guarantees, including the recapitalisation. </p>
<p>The two questions <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me to be related to the spreads between the overnight index swap rate and the various EURIBOR interest rates. </p>
<p>We have to do all that is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in order to get the money market functioning normally again, to get commercial banks granting loans and credit normally again. </p>
<p>I remain very prudent, very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> in this respect. </p>
<p>Had you asked the question yesterday, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have said that the market and most of the economists were <span class='uncertainty'>predicting</span> 50 basis points. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have said the same in reverse: that they were much too tough, or that we were too accommodating, but you know very well that it would have been a wrong analysis: we were doing what we had to do, taking into account the circumstances </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the outright purchases, I think it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are looking at the situation as <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span> and attentively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And I have explained why we consider that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the downside. </p>
<p>What is important is that we <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have a combination of liquidity-hoarding by the commercial banks, by the participants in this particular market, and of credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment, as well as <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> some other premia that have also to be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>Again, I have said that in comparison with the Eurosystem staff baseline scenario, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the downside for growth. </p>
<p>We are all doing what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is appropriate. </p>
<p>We have experienced a period when oil and commodity prices went dramatically, sharply up to levels that were absolutely <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> only a few months ago, or even weeks ago. </p>
<p>All that being said, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see what are our projections, the Eurosystem staff projections, and you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that, as regards inflation, we see inflation for next year as an average between 1.1% and 1.7%, from 3.2% to 3.4% this year, so the disinflationary process I was referring to is very clear and will extend into 2010, as I said a moment ago. </p>
<p>That being said, the worst <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> attitude would be to make anybody a scapegoat. </p>
<p>All institutions have to cope with exceptionally difficult situations, and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is up to all of us to be up to our responsibilities -- the private sector as well as the public sector. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is certainly something which we have in mind and we will have to examine that and reflect on that. </p>
<p>But again, a number of <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> are being examined on a permanent basis. </p>
<p>It is because we consider that there has been a considerable alleviation of inflationary pressures and of upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that we have decreased rates by 175 basis points over a period which is a very short period of time, less than two months. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, we were the first central bank in the world to identify that we were entering a turbulent episode of the first magnitude and that we had to be active and expeditious in decision-making in those circumstances. </p>
<p>So, in a way, this is something that explains <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> why I do not say anything on January, for instance. </p>
<p>It is vitally important that we get back to normal as rapidly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I will not comment in any respect on what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do next time. </p>
<p>Now, you tell me that we did <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a little less than others. </p>
<p>Our analysis was that we had a substantial, a significant further alleviation of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and that, in line with our framework, taking into account our two-pillar strategy and the cross-checking between our two analyses, it was appropriate to take that decision. </p>
<p>We considered it was appropriate, taking into account a further alleviation of the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, as I have explained. </p>
<p>As always, we decide <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the analysis that we are making on the basis of facts, data, all information available and the judgement, experience and collegial wisdom of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>On the first question, it is very important not to <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the words and concepts themselves. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on loans I would take advantage of your question to mention that we consider it extremely important at this stage that the decisions that have been taken at the level of the governments, and I have to say that we ourselves called for those bold decisions to be taken, in particular the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of recapitalisation, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of granting guarantees, is something that is very important to implement as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>That being said, we will see exactly what will happen and we have reasons also to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that progressively we will have the recovery that you were mentioning, but as an average for 2009, as you can see, the projections are negative, or between -1% and 0. </p>
<p>We decreased rates by 175 basis points in less than two months because what we had observed was an alleviation of upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of inflation. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-01-15</b>, 38 sentences</p></div><p>So, these are our reasons ; we are <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> what we expect to be confirmed, namely a significant further slowing down of the economy. </p>
<p>We will discuss the matter as expeditiously and professionally as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We were <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> a further significant slowdown compared with our previous Eurosystem staff projections. </p>
<p>On the handling of the money market, you know that our main aim is to revive the money market, to help it to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I have explained that today 's decision was made taking into account developments since our last decision-making meeting and also <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> what we expect to be the confirmation of a very significant alleviation of inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with a very significant slowing down of the economy. </p>
<p>So our decision comprises both our observation of what has already happened based on the new information which has become available since our last decision-making meeting and the sentiment of the Governing Council that we have to <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> further slowdown and therefore the further alleviation of the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>There is an article in the Treaty -- Article 105.6 -- that says explicitly that, following agreement by the various executive branches, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be given further responsibility. </p>
<p>I can mention that Article 105 -LRB- 6 -RRB- of the Treaty itself explicitly mentions the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for executive branches to decide to confer upon the ECB additional responsibilities in the domain of banking surveillance -- not insurance surveillance, but banking surveillance. </p>
<p>Therefore, let 's not focus on this short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>: the needle in our compass is medium-term inflation, in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>And so the fact that the Governing Council of the ECB always calls on Member States to stick to the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> Pact is fully backed not only by the legal consideration that the Pact is the uniting framework on which the executive branches were unanimous, but also by financial consideration and by economic consideration and, particularly, the Ricardian effect that I mentioned on behalf of the Governing Council in this Introductory Statement, namely the fact that confidence in the sustainability -- the long-term sustainability -- of the fiscal position is very important for the economy -- for the confidence of economic agents, whether households or corporate. </p>
<p>Based on this, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that medium-term inflation is broadly balanced and in line with our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>At the same time I told you that we will not fall into what we consider to be a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> liquidity trap, which is something that we would deem dangerous for our own economy, taking into account our own circumstances, and that we also have other means, other ways, if necessary, of embarking on" non-standard action ''. </p>
<p>We will continue to be as active as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the various international groupings, both informal and formal. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that today 's decision is the right decision to ensure that we deliver inflation in the medium term in line with our definition of price stability, which is not simply 2%, but" below, but close to 2% '', meaning that" close to 2% '' is part of our definition of price stability. </p>
<p>Of course, headline inflation <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> enormously on oil and commodity prices. </p>
<p>If this were the case, I would tell you that we are at 2% and now we consider that we will stay at 2% and will wait for the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> future increase. </p>
<p>I know that the de Larosière Commission <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also examine the issue. </p>
<p>As I have already said, we were taking into account a significant further alleviation of inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, owing in particular, but not exclusively, to the slowdown of the global and European economies. </p>
<p>The Governing Council has observed that there was a further alleviation of the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>In terms of anchoring inflation expectations, which is very important from both perspectives, it is important to avoid expectations of very high inflation -- which we have done as responsibly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- and it is also important that inflation be anchored close to 2% -- as it has been since the start of the euro -- in order to avoid the reverse counterproductive effects. </p>
<p>As regards the quantitative aspect I already said that we had a balance sheet that had doubled since the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> in August 2007. </p>
<p>The main aim of this re-widening of the corridor is to push the banks as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> into returning to their own intrabank transactions. </p>
<p>On your last point, I would totally exclude any kind of hypothesis such as the one you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>. </p>
<p>I said that the next important meeting would, in my opinion, be in March, even if we are not pre-committed -- I insist on that because it is our own fundamental framework -- but we will see what we have to do: it will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> entirely on the needle in our compass: delivering price stability in the medium term, in line with our definition:" below 2%, but close to 2% ''. </p>
<p>Again, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have largely <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> today what is likely to be observed. </p>
<p>So we will continue to be as pragmatic, effective and efficient as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in this domain. </p>
<p>As regards a global approach to banking regulation, we are certainly in favour of as close as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> cooperation between banking surveillance authorities at the global level. </p>
<p>We said -- and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is a very important observation -- that we are <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> bad news from the real economy and a further alleviation of inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We will take into account all elements, the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, the expectations. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen, we have a view of looking at what happens in this shorter part of the very short yield curve. </p>
<p>This is part of the overall financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> that we have to cope with. </p>
<p>I say that of course this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be time for a celebration and congratulations. </p>
<p>I am not saying that 2% was considered ex-ante by the Governing Council as a low level which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be displaced. </p>
<p>We do what we have to do at any time ; we consider that it is our duty and our responsibility to be, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so, neither behind the curve nor ahead of the curve, but to do at any given time exactly what we judge appropriate. </p>
<p>We look at what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do or should do, taking everything into account. </p>
<p>So it is something which is very substantial, as you have said yourself, and it is something which is associated with the fact that, since the beginning of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, we have had a very high level of openness as regards collateral eligibility. </p>
<p>We proved that we were pragmatic -- nobody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have expected that our balance sheet would double since July 2007 -- and I exclude nothing ex ante. </p>
<p>It is our function of risk-taker in an environment where we are under a considerable new set of constraints in the economy and in the finance associated with the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> which started in 2007 and increased considerably in mid-September last year. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-02-05</b>, 40 sentences</p></div><p>I said already that I did not exclude other <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> non-standard measures. </p>
<p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that one element of confidence they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have, would be to see precisely the rapidity and the boldness of the reaction that has taken place until now. </p>
<p>But there is equally a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of being over-pessimistic and of missing the moment when we will have the recovery, which will happen of course. </p>
<p>There was a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in being overconfident and that has proved to be a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that some of them were taking. </p>
<p>I have only to say that they have all, in my opinion, to remain alert because, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> remains of the essence: we are very much in a" Knightian '' universe. </p>
<p>Or close to, I would say, credit easing <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, as you know is the term used on the other side of the Atlantic. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is something like that he <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have had in mind. </p>
<p>It is the households that are saving more than we would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>, particularly in a number of countries where savings are already very high. </p>
<p>We are looking at all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> views and angles of vision for inflation expectations. </p>
<p>I have to say at this stage that we remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because, again, these are facts and figures and we have to look at it and to be permanently alert. </p>
<p>I do not want to repeat too lengthily what I have said, but I would say that, regarding <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability over the medium term, <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> further declines in commodity prices or a stronger than expected slowdown in the economy <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> put downward pressure on inflation, whilst upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> materialise if the falling commodity prices were to reverse and if domestic pressures turn out to be stronger. </p>
<p>I would not say that we have constraints that explain why we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not introduce other non-standard measures. </p>
<p>This is something which I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> describe as a non-standard set of decisions that have augmented considerably, to say the least, our own risk-taking, because of the increase in the size of the balance sheet. </p>
<p>Second, in the present framework I guess that the reasoning of the European executive branches -- I take the Council as a college -- would be that they have the European Investment Bank -LRB- EIB -RRB-, which has its own capacity to finance the European economy, which has its own capacity to borrow on its own signature, which is a European signature, and that they <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> consider that the instruments exist already. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that you would have to ask governments the question. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say the same for what we are extracting from markets, even if, of course, the break-even on the basis of a very short number of years is influenced by what is expected in the present year. </p>
<p>Also, when I compare some expectations on either side of the Atlantic, I see a big difference, obviously, between those expectations, and I take it that this is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> partially due to the fact that we ourselves are very clear on what our definition is. </p>
<p>But this is, in my opinion, proving that by being as explicit as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> on our definition of price stability, we are helping the anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium term. </p>
<p>As I said, we see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> downward and we see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> upward, and these are very clear. </p>
<p>We are in an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> universe but, looking at what has been decided, I will not diagnose that either central banks or governments or authorities in general have been slow or shy or timid in their own reactions. </p>
<p>First of all, as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> means fixing, together with the Commission the appropriate medium-term target and a credible pace for reaching the medium-term target in order to restore confidence and to consolidate confidence. </p>
<p>We have to look, of course, at our own <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, taking into account that one characteristic of the set of non-standard decisions we took already was that it increased our own credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- taking. </p>
<p>But I have noted that what is - at the moment I 'm speaking - present in the market would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be more the first figure that you have mentioned. </p>
<p>So, what we have to do - and in that domain we have still a lot to do - would be to convince them that there are also two-way <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And what happens is that we see that the EONIA has a tendency to hover over the deposit rate, wherever it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>On your first question, I have nothing further to add to what I have said: a zero rate does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to us to be appropriate at this stage. </p>
<p>On today 's meeting, I will only say that it was a meeting as usual where we looked in-depth at all situations and we exchanged all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> views. </p>
<p>And, of course, it means implicitly that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> continue to engage in non-standard operations without having decided to set a zero rate. </p>
<p>This was decided over a time span of <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> three months, which is absolutely exceptional and without any precedent. </p>
<p>I do not exclude that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> decrease rates in our next meeting. </p>
<p>And this is not something new because we had said it a number of times, including here on the occasion of these press conferences, the disorderly unwinding of global imbalances having been noted as a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in particular in the G7 communiqué and by us of course. </p>
<p>What we had decided, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, was to broaden our corridor in order to help, on the basis of the analysis made, revive the money market. </p>
<p>At this stage, I do not want to comment on or qualify what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do or not do. </p>
<p>We have to cope with this exceptional intensification of the crisis which came in September 2008 At the moment I am speaking it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that authorities, whether central banks or governments, have really taken decisions that are until now commensurate with the exceptional circumstances in which they were put very sharply, very abruptly, in mid -- September. </p>
<p>We do not know what will be or is the law of <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of future events. </p>
<p>Part of the confidence that we have to recreate <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the sentiment that, in the medium to long term we will come back to a sustainable pace of policies. </p>
<p>I see a" menu of options '': after the recapitalisations, after the guarantees, we now see the need in some circumstances for additional <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> tools, namely the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of purchasing, or putting aside, toxic or vulnerable assets, and also this idea of having a" tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> '' guarantee for assets that would remain on the balance sheets of various banks. </p>
<p>We have an important role to play -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a more important role to play after this experience than was the case before, as an anchor of stability. </p>
<p>And it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that in a world which has been marked by extreme <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, extreme short-termism and extreme absence of consideration for long-term values, such as long-term price stability and financial stability. </p>
<p>We are, in this domain, in a situation where <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is high. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-03-05</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>We must take care of that, it is not something which can be taken for granted eternally, but it helps us considerably in circumstances in which there are significant inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So it is not surprising that we have concentrated our attention on commercial banks and on being as forthcoming as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> as regards this channel. </p>
<p>As a matter of prudence, we also decided at the level of the Governing Council, that the NCBs should establish their respective shares of an appropriate total provision in their annual accounts for 2008 as a buffer against <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> arising for the monetary policy operations. </p>
<p>At this stage there has been no discussion with executive branches as regards any help or any guarantees or any support that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be given. </p>
<p>On your first question, we are looking very carefully and constantly at the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation -- as the OECD and the IMF are doing. </p>
<p>Another consequence is that our own balance sheet has augmented substantially, and, if you wish to have an order of magnitude we have an augmentation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we are taking ourselves in our own balance sheet since the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> in August 2007, which is of the order of magnitude of 600 billion euro, of the order of magnitude of 800 billion dollars. </p>
<p>Before the methodology just mentioned, we had another methodology which used the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that you take the interest rates where they are and they do not change: Interest rate policy was unchanged in the previous methodology. </p>
<p>The conclusion of the international institutions in general is that such <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are very minimal in our case. </p>
<p>Further decisions will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on facts, figures and judgement of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>Regarding your third question, I will confirm that there was a consensus, after a very in-depth discussion as we are in a very multi-dimensional, complex and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> world. </p>
<p>If justified by facts and figures, if some of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I mentioned are materialising, I clearly wo n't rule out the main policy rate being changed, indeed going down. </p>
<p>As regards the present level of the main refinancing operations, we did not decide ex-ante that this was the lowest point that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> attain. </p>
<p>We proved that we were able to weather periods which were very demanding in times of upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>And, as I have repeatedly said today, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is the mark of the time. </p>
<p>Again, we are studying <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> additional non-standard measures. </p>
<p>It is not good to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that some are in such a weak situation that you would amend the rules for the sake of that situation. </p>
<p>The commercial banks are playing a much more important role in the euro area than it is the case in the United States in particular, but <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> also in the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>If I now take the aggregate net result of the Eurosystem national central banks, including the distribution of the net result that the ECB has been distributed to the NCBs and which goes onto their own balance sheet, then this net result is estimated to be <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> $ 16.8 billion for 2008. </p>
<p>If and when particular countries <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have major difficulties, it is always <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, as has been proved in several cases, that there is help available from the European Union itself and from the European Commission and which is backed by governments. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to make a distinction between the western part of Europe and the eastern part of Europe, which I do not like since we are all on exactly the same footing and the only pertinent differences for me are that some are members of the euro area, others are members of ERM II, others are members of the European Union without being members of the euro area or ERM II and others are out of the European Union itself. </p>
<p>The net figures I gave you -- for the level of the net result of the Eurosystem - namely <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> $ 16.8 billion is calculated after this provisioning. </p>
<p>And one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also say that you have candidate countries and non-candidate countries. </p>
<p>So again we had a surplus of <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> $ 2.7 billion in 2008. </p>
<p>Some of them would say that they are in a situation which is difficult and would ask for help, while others would say that they are in a situation which is solid and strong and resilient and they should not all be <span class='uncertainty'>confused</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> of the ECB, based upon our assessment, an amount of $ 1.339 billion was transferred from this surplus to the provision that we are making against foreign exchange <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, interest rate and gold price <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It is the total provisioning we have made in order to face up to potential <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As regards further non-standard measures, on top of the two measures I have mentioned, on top of what we have decided today -- to say that we would continue as long as needed and beyond the end of the year -- we are discussing and studying <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> new non-standard measures. </p>
<p>It helps us also very much to weather periods in which, on the contrary, there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be downward pressure on inflation. </p>
<p>So no, there is no substantiation of any significant <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation and we are considerably helped by our definition of price stability and by the anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the issue of members of the euro area that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be in extreme difficulty, first of all the euro area is an area where you have considerable automatic help through the very existence of the single currency itself. </p>
<p>The provision would be used to cover <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> losses arising from the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that I mentioned. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-04-02</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>We constantly look at the various indicators that we have at hand and that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> substantiate the deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but we do not see materialisation of such a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> at the moment. </p>
<p>As regards deflation, we have not changed our diagnosis -- we do not see any substantiation or materialisation of deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>And to the extent that moral suasion is important in the present circumstances in which we find a lack of confidence wherever we look, I would certainly echo what I have said before and what the Governing Council has said, namely that we call on our banks to be as active lenders as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>I would echo all that has been said in the run-up to the important meeting, the G20 which is taking place in London, namely that a great number of decisions have been taken by the authorities with respect to support in the financial sphere and that it is extremely important for all those measures to be implemented as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, measures that are very important for enabling the banking system to lend, which is the task of the banking system. </p>
<p>As regard supply, we are doing whatever we can to keep our banking system as active as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So the two statements together do not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there was an intension to prepare the markets for an implementation of such measures. </p>
<p>I do not want to pre-empt in any respect what we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say then. </p>
<p>But we have to remain extraordinarily pragmatic and humble in the presence of facts and figures in a period in which <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is greater than ever. </p>
<p>When I look at the medium term, I am looking at the inflation expectations expressed in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and we will have to see what it says in a month 's time, but thus far since the setting up of the euro these expectations have <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuated</span> between 1.7% and 2%. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why we said that we felt that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation, in particular, were balanced, because we also take into account the decisions that have been taken since the last set of projections was issued. </p>
<p>Obviously, we have facts and figures before us, and we have to understand better how to attribute what we are observing to the demand side and what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> attribute to the supply side. </p>
<p>That, of course, <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the price of oil, but I hope that the price of oil will not go up again. </p>
<p>In response to your first question, as always, we had a very in-depth discussion, we looked at the situation from every <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> angle and we took our decision by consensus. </p>
<p>And I can only tell you that we have judged that it was appropriate, taking all factors into account, to decrease the rate on the main refinancing operations by 25 basis points while, at the same time, we have not decided that this is the lowest point that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be attained. </p>
<p>I mentioned potential further non-standard measures that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be taken. </p>
<p>And as I have said, we are examining carefully all elements that would allow us to be convinced at the level of the Governing Council that we are optimising what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be done, and should be done, in our view, to enhance credit support and be sure that we have an optimised set of non-standard measures. </p>
<p>And we were the first, as <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you remember, to embark upon very audacious and bold measures, including the unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates. </p>
<p>I do not exclude that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> -- in a very measured way -- go down from the present level. </p>
<p>We are in a world which is difficult and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>This is something which needs to be known and is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> due to a combination of lower <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and lower liquidity premia on our own money market rates. </p>
<p>It is worth remembering that, a few months ago, I told you that we would make every effort to revive our money market and to allow it function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be true in the future. </p>
<p>I will only tell you, although you know that, already that I participated as actively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the ministers and governors ' meeting that took place in Brighton. </p>
<p>So I do not rule out the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> reduce the width of the corridor. </p>
<p>When I look at all these projections, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is true that the OECD projections <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> at this moment in time to be more negative than the private sector projections and the other public sector projections, including those of the IMF. </p>
<p>I would say on the first point that my reading of the market rates and of the expectations that can be extracted from the money market was that they saw a <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of 50% for a decrease of 50 basis points and 100% for a decrease of at least 25 basis points. </p>
<p>And all this is something that we should not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> with deflation, because -- on the contrary -- it is a factor that is expansionary, because we are distributing purchasing power to our fellow citizens through lower prices of oil and commodities. </p>
<p>Again, we looked at the situation from every <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> angle and we decided by consensus. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-05-07</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>We have not decided that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> never cross whatever the future circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be. </p>
<p>As regards the issue of future rates, we did not decide that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>Covered bonds were considered by the Governing Council as a segment of the private securities markets that in general has been particularly affected, more so than others, in terms of the impact of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>. </p>
<p>There are several reasons for this and they <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> in terms of their importance across countries. </p>
<p>As regards your first question, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> put the same question to all central banks in the world, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> n't you? </p>
<p>For example, banks ' needs for government guarantees <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the time profile of the maturity of their debt and they also reflect the relatively subdued demand for bank loans of the private sector. </p>
<p>I would add, however, that in some cases <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> other factors are discouraging the use of government guarantees by banks, and this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to do either with the pricing of the guarantees on long-term debt or with some specific factors that are discouraging their use. </p>
<p>We are coping with the means we have to handle the money market, with the credibility of this handling and with the liquidity and credit <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> incorporated in the money market interest rates. </p>
<p>I said we did not decide today that they were at the lowest <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> level. </p>
<p>And at the same time we have incorporated in today 's decision all available pieces of information and analyses, including the fact that we know in advance that we will have a level of projections, concerning growth in particular, that will be substantially lower than the previous staff projections and in line <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> with what we see as the overall analysis based on the already known facts and figures. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is fundamental not only because it makes it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to avoid either inflation or deflation, but also because it solidly anchors the confidence of our fellow citizens and of economic agents. </p>
<p>Whether it was the longer-term refinancing of commercial banks, or at the beginning of the turmoil being the most forthcoming central bank as regards its collateral framework, or when we had to take bold action in particular at the very beginning of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> on 9 August 2007. </p>
<p>In particular the fact that the first quarter was much less flattering than projected by all observers and institutions, and that we already know that the new staff projections, which will be published in June, will be <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> down significantly compared with our previous staff projections three months ago and will very likely be in line with the most recent projections published for 2009 growth, in particular by the Commission and the IMF. </p>
<p>I would say, at this stage, that we expect to engage in a programme that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be around $ 60 billion. </p>
<p>To your first question, it should be noted that we did not decide today that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be. </p>
<p>As regards today 's decision taking into account all elements we considered that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> and we should go beyond what had been until now our main channel for enhanced credit support mainly by the refinancing of commercial banks which has, by the way, produced important results. </p>
<p>If you wish, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> call that credit easing, because it is a way of improving the functioning of the market that had been affected particularly markedly by the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>. </p>
<p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us, on our capacity to improve the level of confidence of all economic agents that these ` green shoots ' will be greener and greener, and that will permit what we all want: the recovery to operate as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and without hampering in any respect the long-term future of stability and the long-term confidence of economic agents. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> use our own vocabulary, it is part of our" enhanced credit support '' operations. </p>
<p>In both cases we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see what I would call the ` second derivative ' changing its sign. </p>
<p>We are not in the position that we would have to defend ourselves against the fact that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not get out of the non-conventional measures taken. </p>
<p>Let me only say that we rely upon the extreme vigilance of all national surveillance authorities, and we have always encouraged them to be in as close cooperation and collaboration as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>What we have done today gives you an idea of what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the appropriate balance should be in the present circumstances with all their complexity. </p>
<p>I gave you already the order of magnitude of what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do in this domain. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-06-04</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>All the information I have from all the euro area countries and fellow citizens points in the same direction, without a <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>2010 is a year, at least in the view of the majority of forecasters, including our own staff -- the staff of the Eurosystem, not only the staff of the ECB -- when the first half of the year will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be at a level of zero and the second half positive, and the year will have a profile which would pick up. </p>
<p>And again, I reiterate the fact that the final result <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us. </p>
<p>But at this stage I would say, we remain very alert, but we do not see a change in the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>But at the same time, the market more or less <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> that there are also <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the other direction. </p>
<p>And again I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> quote a very large number of cases where I reiterated our fierce independence. </p>
<p>They <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on our capacity to increase confidence. </p>
<p>And I have to say, in this respect, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> see that in the introductory statement of the Governing Council, there is this recommendation for the financial sector in particular to accelerate the strengthening of the capital bases of the banks and also to utilise more fully the decisions that have already been taken as regards recapitalisation in particular. </p>
<p>Indeed, we were, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> immodestly say so, the first to diagnose that we had a real problem, and the first to take very important decisions, as early as 9 August 2007. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Uncertainty</span> is of course involved there. </p>
<p>On your second question: no, we do not see a change in those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I was referring to the domestic measures that the government has to take in order to continue the adjustment in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and I do not have any other comments on that. </p>
<p>The future course of the economy <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the rapidity of the implementation of decisions already taken. </p>
<p>I remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We increased rates in December 2005, when 10 governments out of 12 were calling on us not to increase rates, and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> quote a number of similar circumstances. </p>
<p>I can only tell you that, as regards the duration of those bonds -- and I wo n't pre-commit, because we will have to optimise these operations, taking into account the market situation and the various constraints that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have -- we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> concentrate on the medium to longer term, say, three to ten years. </p>
<p>I would only add that the future growth <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us. </p>
<p>But I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give many other examples. </p>
<p>It is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> our main asset, because it served us extremely well in the period where we had very significant inflationary pressures. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you read that, but it is not what she said. </p>
<p>So we will continue to look at it but we are very mindful of the need for our money market to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We saw the EONIA decline again in the most recent period, and there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be a number of other reasons for this, given that we are at the end of the maintenance period. </p>
<p>And when we look at the information we can extract from financial markets, namely the five-years forward five-years break-even inflation rate, which we consider one of the most pertinent indicators of information that we can extract from financial markets, we are at a level of 2.5% which is in line with our definition of price stability taking into account the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia that are embedded. </p>
<p>And I also have nothing to add to or change in terms of what I said a month ago -- and I quote this word for word -- that" we did not decide today that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level that can never be crossed, whatever future circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be ''. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that there is currently a" learning by doing '' process among market participants. </p>
<p>We decide on the basis of our own judgement, and I was extremely happy that Kanzlerin Merkel <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> confirm that she fully backed our independence and appreciated what we were doing. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-07-02</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that only 55 - 56% of the recapitalisation capital has been utilised. </p>
<p>It protects us from the longer-term <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of inflation occurring in the future and we are pleased to say that it has also functioned well in terms of protecting us from the shorter-term threats of deflation, which never materialised in our case. </p>
<p>That 's absolutely clear, and it is also one of the reasons why we have decided not to take on additional <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with the purchase of securities that would increase our <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>In both cases, we have a double guarantee, which is something that we considered appropriate taking into account the fact that we have a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, closely related to the fact that we have an accommodating collateral framework. </p>
<p>This is fully in line with the need to be careful regarding <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>We also call upon them to take full advantage of the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> which are being offered to reinforce their balance sheets. </p>
<p>And, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, we call upon them to take advantage of the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>, including recapitalisation, which exist at the level of the euro area. </p>
<p>I have said explicitly that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this purchase of covered bonds is very much in line with what we are doing with our own refinancing operations, because we have in front of us the signature, backing or guarantee of the counterparties -- the commercial banks themselves -- plus the collateral in the one case, or the assets covering the bonds in the other. </p>
<p>I do not think that there is any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in the minds of observers, market participants, investors and households that we would be fully capable of doing that. </p>
<p>Therefore, as regards the duration of these covered bonds, I will stick to what I said earlier, it will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on a case-by-case basis what is the appropriate duration of these covered bonds, but it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go from three years to ten years. </p>
<p>When I call for the restructuring of the balance sheets of commercial banks to be as proactive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, this is something which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span>, to be appropriate considering the challenges that we face. </p>
<p>From this point of view, we are very happy because we can clearly see that we have decreased the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia. </p>
<p>We have seen a number of consequences in the term money market, in particular for the one-year rate where the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia are lower than in other equivalent money markets. </p>
<p>Our main aim is to have an appropriate functioning of the money market and to diminish the various <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia on this market as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are looking very carefully at all the elements which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> permit us to be enlightened on the supply and demand aspects of the credit provision and, taking into account the global decline of activity -- particularly in a number of cases the very sharp decline of global trade -- we trust that it is not surprising that demand is playing a very important role in the slowing down of credit that we are now seeing. </p>
<p>And I am referring to market reinforcement of balance sheets through, in particular, a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> issuance of new capital, which would be subscribed by the private sector. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is commensurate with the challenges that we have. </p>
<p>In special cases, a Eurosystem central bank <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decide to purchase outright covered bonds with an issue size of below $ 500 million, provided that the issue size is not below $ 100 million, where it decides, at its own discretion, that specific market circumstances relating to <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management considerations require such a purchase. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-08-06</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>As regards unemployment, which was your second question, I can only say that you are right in mentioning the fact that it is one of the major points which calls for us to be prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the Governing Council of the ECB has always been extremely <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> vis-à-vis rules of monetary policy based on estimates of growth potential, because you know in advance that the estimate of potential growth will <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span>, in some cases very significantly, from the estimates produced in real time. </p>
<p>So what you referred to is just <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span>. </p>
<p>We will still have the very great <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of figures for employment and unemployment that will not be flattering for a significant period of time. </p>
<p>It is clear that there are lagged effects in this domain and even when the economy picks up unemployment <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> continue to grow. </p>
<p>But as far as we are concerned, we are very prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We are viewed by observers as being one of the central banks which undoubtedly has all the means to implement an effective exit strategy when we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it to be necessary and appropriate. </p>
<p>And I would not comment particularly on one economy, because it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that what we are observing in terms of surveys, as well as in terms of soft data and hard data, is by and large in line in the various national economies that make up the euro area. </p>
<p>That being said, I fully accept the consensus of economists that the potential growth of all economies of the industrialised world is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> now significantly lower than the previous estimate. </p>
<p>If we look at the state-of-the-art methodologies for determining the potential growth rate -- and the European Commission I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> has published documents in this respect -- you see that the most recent observed data have a big influence: you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span> discover that the potential rate of growth for a large number of previous years was overestimated at the time the calculations were made. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see the impact that they had on the markets themselves, which we consider -- I am being prudent also on this point -- had the kind of impact that we were looking for, even if we still have to -- if it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- improve, in particular, the behaviour of the secondary market. </p>
<p>First of all, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is very important to have an exit strategy, and you heard what I said on behalf of the Governing Council just a moment ago: the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and that the ample liquidity provided is absorbed. </p>
<p>It is not our intention to do anything at the moment I am speaking, unless to apply and implement previous decisions as effectively and professionally as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It is therefore not entirely satisfactory to be the prisoner of methodologies that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> change significantly past estimates. </p>
<p>What we have published in the monetary aggregate counterparts <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that the diminishing of short-term credit is very important. </p>
<p>To give you very precise figures, if I look at the loans of up to one year to non-financial corporations, the monthly flow in June 2009 is minus $ 30 billion, which accounts for <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> the totality of what we are observing at the level of the total outstanding amount, which is minus $ 35 billion. </p>
<p>So we have to remain very prudent and very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>But, again, I do not rule out that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have contradictory signs and that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> again have confirmation that we are in an economically <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> episode. </p>
<p>We can not both tell the banks that in the past they took very abnormal <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, exhibited abnormal behaviour and so forth, and then tell them now to forget about their <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> appreciation and their judgement. </p>
<p>So, we will see and do not over-interpret what I have said, the profile <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> remain very close and in any case <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is unfortunately very high in the present circumstances. </p>
<p>On your second point, I do not hide the fact that the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of commodity prices is an enormous problem for the global economy, for all economies in the world and certainly also for all central banks in the world. </p>
<p>We would like the supply side of the financing not to be a constraint, or as little a constraint as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>At this stage, I would only say that we do not exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a profile next year which would be slightly different. </p>
<p>I confirm what you have said, that in view of the Governing Council this law 's provisions on the taxation of Banca d'Italia 's gold reserves raise very serious concerns as regards <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> infringements of Community law. </p>
<p>That being said, there are certainly also supply aspects, and we are as active as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in trying to understand what can be done to alleviate these supply constraints. </p>
<p>We have to live in an environment which from that standpoint creates a very high level of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>But, as you know, recapitalisation can be done in two ways: it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be done with public money, but it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be with private money through the issuance of new stocks and shares, as is being observed at a global level. </p>
<p>So, our message remains absolutely the same, telling the financial sector in general that it would be very appropriate to repair the damage as actively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and to make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for the financial sector and the banks to do their job, which is to lend. </p>
<p>I would say that, at the level of the" Gs '' and the meetings of the central bank governors at a global level, this issue of the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of commodity prices is one of the major issues where we consider we have a lot of progress to make. </p>
<p>We are in an episode in economic history where <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> remains very high. </p>
<p>We will not change the way in which we operate for such <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> spreads, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be decided for all the term refinancing that we are carrying out. </p>
<p>And we would be more than happy if recapitalisation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be undertaken more actively in the euro area and in Europe in general. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-09-03</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>So a too simple analysis which relies upon the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the same institution does both -- asking for liquidity and replacing in the central bank - does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be right ; it is more complex than that. </p>
<p>With regard to the inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in the longer term, I can reassure our fellow citizens on behalf of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>And it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that this has now been clearly established, even if we always have to remain alert. </p>
<p>And let me say that, if inflation expectations have been correctly anchored, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this was because the Governing Council is trusted to be able to avoid the materialisation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation in the short term. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the central banks have played a decisive role in avoiding the catastrophe. </p>
<p>I do not exclude, taking into account all the new information that we have had, that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have, on a quarter -- on-quarter basis, a return to positive growth before mid-2010. </p>
<p>So, I do not rule out the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have positive quarter-on-quarter growth and then a much less flattering evolution in the next quarter. </p>
<p>We certainly have a higher <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> than before, taking into account what we have seen in the past month, of having positive growth, but again a bumpy road is also pretty <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and we have to be fully aware of that. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> very well be, in a large majority of cases, that these are not the same institutions. </p>
<p>The worst <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> attitude would be to say that, now that we can see that the financial markets are functioning much better again, now that we can see that asset prices are going up again, now that we can see that we have a number of indications of our returning to normal, it can be" business as usual '' again. </p>
<p>Our capacity to anchor expectations <span class='uncertainty'>differs</span> and we face different levels of threat. </p>
<p>The overall decisions and orientations, taken by the G20 have made it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, on the basis of a broad consensus at the global level, to avoid the materialisation of these threats that were extremely dangerous. </p>
<p>We will see exactly how the London meeting goes at the level of ministers and governors -- I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that previous decisions taken by and the strategy previously defined at the level of the G20 ministers and governors and at the level of Heads of State and Government, has been effective. </p>
<p>Again, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, they should do whatever is necessary in order to reinforce their capital base -- including, of course, taking advantage of the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> offered by public authorities. </p>
<p>Let me mention that the Governing Council has noted some figures that were better than expected -- in particular as regards surveys, but also some hard figures -- and has also noted that our staff were <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that the previous projections be <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> upwards <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>. </p>
<p>We had to cope with a period of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> two quarters or seven months of a free-fall in the global economic activity, as well as in each individual economy. </p>
<p>We see that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, as I have said on behalf of the Governing Council, is very high, and we have to be fully aware of that. </p>
<p>Again, when I add up all the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to taxpayers -- that has been put on the table after the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008, when you look at the option of recapitalisation, the option of guarantees of all kinds, including for medium-term refinancing, the option of impaired assets in a number of cases and so on, we end up with an enormous amount of public money -- public <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have a bumpy road ahead of us, taking into account the full complexity of the situation and, again, the fact that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is high. </p>
<p>These <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>, in particular, have by far not been fully utilised. </p>
<p>The range shows that there is a large degree of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and so prudence and caution are of the essence. </p>
<p>I give you a rendez-vous for future <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions when the time comes. </p>
<p>As regards growth next year, which will of course also be influenced by growth this year since we have the carry-over, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> remains a major factor. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be that a significant number of institutions are themselves without any liquidity needs, are not asking for liquidity to the central bank and for a variety of reasons are replacing their own excess of liquidity in the deposit facility. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-10-08</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>I personally think that in the present situation, where we have the most dramatic challenge for global finance and the global economy certainly since the Second World War and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> since the 1930s, it is remarkable that we have a global consensus on the methodology between emerging markets and industrialised countries and in the G20 in particular. </p>
<p>So, even after recovery has begun and positive growth has returned, we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have to cope with an increase in unemployment. </p>
<p>This is, of course, part of the reason why we have to be as active as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in improving confidence, because this scenario is a result of an absence of confidence. </p>
<p>It is absolutely clear that our non-standard measures have been designed to facilitate credit -- the loans and the financing of the private sector of the real economy -- as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I think it 's an important sign, and we should certainly encourage this as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> I just add something? </p>
<p>We have different fiscal policies, with <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> levels of credibility for those fiscal policies, and we can see the difference in the spreads, which are very important in terms of facilitating the recovery -- or not. </p>
<p>We also call for the banks to take advantage of all <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> in terms of improving their balance sheets in order to be able to finance the real economy as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>One of the reasons why we say that we have to be very prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and why we say that we have a bumpy road ahead of us, even if we are out of this dramatic period of freefall, is unemployment. </p>
<p>I would only say that I <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to consider that it does indeed signal that money markets are progressively beginning to function more normally again. </p>
<p>There is the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of unemployment increasing because there are lags. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is true that $ 75 billion <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to be a sign of stabilisation, and this is the way that most observers have looked at it. </p>
<p>On the oil and commodity price, I have mentioned this as an element of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the present circumstances, which is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for inflation in particular and for the economy. </p>
<p>And those that are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that it is now <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> back to" business as usual '' are plain wrong. </p>
<p>The various savers and investors have various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>. </p>
<p>We were able to avoid the materialisation of deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in the euro area, because we benefited considerably from the solid anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>This calls for <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> also to be taken into account -- <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> that are exceptionally high in the view of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we still have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and to be prudent. </p>
<p>And of course it is the responsibility of the executive branch and parliament to be as credible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in order to facilitate the financing of their own economy ; not only the financing of the treasury, but the financing of all other entities -- including private entities -- in the economy. </p>
<p>As I have said, we have a President and he <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be better. </p>
<p>On your first question, I would say that coordination, when it is <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> very strongly by the European Commission, as it has been in a number of cases, means coordination between governments, and you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have heard Commissioner Almunia being very clear on that both in Istanbul and in Gothenburg recently. </p>
<p>If the price of oil and commodities is going up we have both <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, indeed the worst <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, that is to say a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of falling growth and rising inflation. </p>
<p>As regards your question on the dollar and the euro, I would say that where the floating currencies, the major floating currencies, are concerned, we, the Governing Council of the ECB, <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and for financial stability. </p>
<p>In addition, we encourage governments very strongly, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, to be as sound, reasonable and credible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, because again it is their way of reinforcing confidence and ensuring that their own financial environment is as good as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-11-05</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>We still have in some cases the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of using the recapitalisation option that is offered by governments. </p>
<p>So there is <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> room for manoeuvre there. </p>
<p>I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our capacity to improve the confidence of households and of enterprises, at the euro area level, but also at the European Union level and at the global level. </p>
<p>But we concentrate very much, as you know, on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>Banks are far from utilising this option totally, because we are <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> at 60% utilisation of the overall option. </p>
<p>Confidence will be hampered and what we want right now is to improve confidence as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>This is extremely important for confidence, but it also worked extremely well to prevent the materialisation of deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>But I remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are associated with our enhanced credit support measures are those you mentioned. </p>
<p>I can not <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> what our next staff projections are likely to be: I will comment on them to you in a month 's time. </p>
<p>There is a certain <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that the confirmation provided by these better hard data and soft data will permit us to be a little bit more optimistic. </p>
<p>So, I think we have to remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, even if there is a <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> that we will have confirmation over the last half of this year that we are in positive territory. </p>
<p>The more prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> banks are in this respect, the more they can put aside and reinforce their balance sheets. </p>
<p>I have always said that we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent, and that we <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have a bumpy road ahead of us. </p>
<p>First of all, we will tell all banks, as we always have done, that the extremely bold and important enhanced credit support measures we are providing will not continue <span class='uncertainty'>indefinitely</span> -- we have said that from day one. </p>
<p>On top of that, I draw your attention to the cost of refinancing, which <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the credibility of the strategy. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, I will not comment on the spread, the indexed rates or the absence of them that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decide. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember we invited Chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard d'Estaing to speak about the birth of the ERM, the birth of the European Monetary System, which permitted, after a number of years, the creation of the euro area. </p>
<p>You know our very clear position in this respect: we consider that excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is adverse from the standpoint of the stability and prosperity of the global economy, and of course of the euro area economy. </p>
<p>As you know, we do everything that we can for the supply of credit to be as forthcoming as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So if the refinancing of the treasury <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on much higher interest rates then you are hampering most of the private signatures and private entities in the same country. </p>
<p>So we have the feeling on that point that we are seeing something which is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> encouraging. </p>
<p>Not only our monetary policy and interest rates, but also the non-standard measures that we have decided upon and which have been extremely bold, are aiming at permitting the banking sector to continue to finance as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> the private sector and the economy in general. </p>
<p>But again I am prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2009-12-03</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>However, the responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations will rest either with national authorities -- supervisory or economic -- or, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the recommendation, with the European Commission or the European Supervisory Authorities. </p>
<p>I would say that each of us, each member of the Governing Council, very carefully weighed up the advantages and disadvantages with regard to every <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decision. </p>
<p>On the issue of independence, I think it is very important that the ESRB and the members of the Board perform their tasks in the interest of the Union in order to prevent and mitigate systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It is absolutely essential that the macro-prudential recommendations are translated into effective action if we are going to accomplish the ultimate objective of the new framework for macro-prudential supervision, which is to prevent or at least to minimise the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of future crises and to strengthen the resilience of the financial system. </p>
<p>As you know, the main tasks of the ESRB will be to identify and assess systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and to issue <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> warnings and recommendations in order to address these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> if they are considered to be significant. </p>
<p>We are maintaining exceptional measures that are extremely generous, as you can see, precisely because we want to be just in our behaviour, and because we do not want to create <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in any area. </p>
<p>As regards your second question I can not elaborate too much on that because it would take a long time, but we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our own monetary policy concept, which is based on two pillars -LRB- i.e. economic analysis and monetary analysis -RRB-, allows us -- thanks to the monetary analysis and the fact that we have a medium-term definition of price stability -- to incorporate elements that are associated with rapid increases in outstanding credit, including the impact on asset inflation, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> itself create inflation through the wealth channel and, if boom is followed by bust, destabilise prices through the deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> materialise. </p>
<p>The Governing Council considers that the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> in particular on whether confidence improves further. </p>
<p>It is urgent, and we are totally determined at the ECB and in the Eurosystem to contribute as effectively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to this necessary improved resilience of the financial system. </p>
<p>We discussed the fundamentals as far as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, starting very clearly with what we considered ourselves to be in the best interest of all parties concerned. </p>
<p>Regarding your first question, as I just indicated, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the decisions we have taken are appropriate. </p>
<p>As regards your question on the one-year refinancing, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have had a fixed rate, namely the MRO rate, as was done the first two times, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have had a rate with a margin, as had always been indicated very clearly to the market as being <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> ; and we had the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of having this indexed rate. </p>
<p>As regards <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the upside the global economy -- and therefore foreign trade -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be more dynamic than is presently foreseen or projected. </p>
<p>And you also have the adverse feedback loop between the real sector and the financial sector, taking into account the magnitude of the recession, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> have been underestimated in the projections. </p>
<p>One of the clear lessons of the past episode, which was a very difficult period, during which we had to take very bold decisions, is that our duty is to be sure that we are correctly weighing up all of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with each and every decision we take. </p>
<p>But again, taking everything into account, we have <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are broadly balanced, together with a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>But we also have a number of very significant <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the downside, which are, in our view, balancing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside. </p>
<p>You remember that, for all those operations, we had said that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have either fixed rates or another way of dealing with it. </p>
<p>In any case, we consider that there is still a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, and we consider the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to be broadly balanced. </p>
<p>First of all, let me confirm that we were unanimous in considering the interest rates to be appropriate, and all the decisions that were taken as regards the phasing out of the non-conventional measures were taken by consensus, after we had carefully weighed the pros and cons of the various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> some private sector projections are significantly better, but this is not necessarily the case in general. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, taking everything into account -- the situation of the market in some respects, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the nervousness of the market -- the measures that we took today were exactly the right compromise between the various constraints that we have. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the monetary aggregates, I confirm that M1 remains quite dynamic, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have noted, even if the rate of growth, which is in double figures, is a little bit lower than before. </p>
<p>First of all I have to say that the Polish economy <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me to have been one of the economies which was the most resilient in the circumstances. </p>
<p>If we have an ex-ante bias in one direction or another, we <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> missing the point and ultimately, having to cope with great difficulties. </p>
<p>We decided by consensus on all these issues and we looked at all the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> as regards the various refinancing operations. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with acting too early and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> associated with acting too late, and we must balance those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>I would say that the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> increases in oil prices and commodity prices certainly constitute a very large downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-01-14</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>We operate in very much the same way as the Federal Reserve System, with our large set of countries, and each time that we have looked at various indicators such as growth, inflation, unit labour cost evolution, in Europe and compared these with the United States, we have found more or less the same order of magnitude of standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span>. </p>
<p>But the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is quite high and I have mentioned the fact that around this baseline scenario we see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside and also on the downside. </p>
<p>That being said, you have <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in both directions. </p>
<p>I have to say that the work which has been done by all of us, -- I 'm speaking in particular of the ECB 's Governing Council as a whole and of a number of members of the Governing Council in various positions, and also of the international community -- was as good as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> a job. </p>
<p>So there is a great level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> pretty well have a rate of growth from quarter to quarter that would go up and down. </p>
<p>And I 'll just sum it up on behalf of the Governing Council: we are looking at inflation in the medium term, price stability in the medium term, and we see at the moment I am speaking no <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for a destabilisation of our prices. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the lessons from the past absence of credibility are such that the government in question is getting the message very clearly, but we will see what is being done. </p>
<p>Without giving details, what I have seen until now <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me to be going in the right direction. </p>
<p>This therefore <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be the characteristic of a very vast single economy of more than 300 million citizens. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen that this sentiment is completely and publicly shared by the Commission. </p>
<p>Using best practices as a benchmark <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be the obvious thing to do when you look at the European Union. </p>
<p>As regard your last question I will not <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that, at this stage, taking into account the very important and bold decisions already taken by governments, our democracies will necessarily renew what they accepted to do at the peak of the crisis. </p>
<p>We will try to help as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> ourselves, and it is obvious that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do much better if we were to improve our structural position, which gives us a very powerful motivation. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> well imagine that you would separate the function of the central bank and that of the supervisory authority in a very appropriate fashion. </p>
<p>So we expect that these red figures <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> continue for a number of months, both for loans to non-financial corporates, for overall loans to the private sector and also for M3 which were slightly negative in November. </p>
<p>I have to say that all Council meetings with ministers have to work as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I will also say again that you should never <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the role of the supervisory authority with the involvement, when unfortunately necessary, of the Treasury. </p>
<p>We do not pronounce on whether or not it should be the concept applied in Italy, Spain, France or <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> Germany or, tomorrow, in other countries in the European Union, but only that there should be a close relationship. </p>
<p>Third comment: banking supervision is organised in all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> ways in industrialised countries and the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Second, speaking very <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span>, I think that the consolidated deficit for the euro area as a whole is between 6.5% and 7%. </p>
<p>If I am not mistaken, the order of magnitude of the percentage of Greek GDP in terms of the euro area is <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> between 2.5% and 3%. </p>
<p>As I have already said, we consider it appropriate that there is a close relationship between the central bank and banking supervision, which <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be a growing trend at the moment also in Belgium and Germany. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-02-04</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>We are all reflecting, not only in Europe but also at the global level, on the different behaviours that we have observed from the employment angle in various countries, to understand better what dynamics are at stake and what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain those differences. </p>
<p>They were due to be submitted before the end of January and this was done in practically all cases, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> know. </p>
<p>Allow me to mention what it is for other major industrialised countries: it will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be a little bit more than 10% for the US according to the IMF, and also a little bit more than 10% for Japan, which is more than 4% above the consolidated fiscal deficit of the euro area. </p>
<p>Second, profits, in our opinion, should serve not to distribute enormous amounts of dividends to shareholders ; not to distribute enormous amounts of bonuses, packages, remunerations to the members of these institutions ; but to reinforce their balance sheets, to reinforce their own position as financial institutions that have a role to play, which is to finance the real economy as actively as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is in the interests of the United States, as well as in the interests of the rest of the world, including Europe. </p>
<p>On other countries and on Greece, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see in the introductory remarks what the Governing Council had said. </p>
<p>I always call for ideas, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be interesting, that are submitted to the international community by different countries to be examined and studied very professionally, actively and rapidly, because the international community requires us to be reasonably expeditious. </p>
<p>And such peer assessment, peer judgement and peer decisions -- including decisions on <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> sanctions -- are at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>The strict inflation targeters -- but they have now enlarged and enriched their own initial concept -- were targeting inflation in, say, <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> two years, and the policy was like a guided missile: the guided missile was modified in order to hit the target in two years ' time. </p>
<p>We will have just the right environment to be as cool as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in judging the situation ! </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is important for the industrialised countries to have this kind of opportunity for meditation, also taking into account their responsibility, including as regards the recent crisis. </p>
<p>And it is clear that those countries that were growing very fast in the past now have growth which is more modest, and those that were not necessarily growing very fast -LRB- Germany, for instance -RRB- will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> demonstrate that they are now growing more dynamically and actively. </p>
<p>It is as numerous as the United States, and I <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that, in a press conference, Ben Bernanke would have a question on Alaska or Massachusetts... </p>
<p>I expect that in this episode of the recovery, Germany will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have more orders and more exports, which will contribute to its growth. </p>
<p>A number of us <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have a very vivid memory of that. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they were right, and I take it that this is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> what the Minister of Finance was alluding to. </p>
<p>Even if it is absolutely clear that the prime grouping for cooperation is the G20 − and that is very clear and fully accepted, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, by the G7, and fully accepted by the central banks, which again have themselves in some way <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> this evolution − nevertheless, it is not absurd for the industrialised countries, which have a major responsibility in the present situation, to meet together, as do the emerging countries themselves from time to time, without claiming any global authority. </p>
<p>We were even, in some respects, <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> that in our constituency of central banks. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-03-04</b>, 36 sentences</p></div><p>And some of the observations that have been made and that you refer to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, because of this particular industry, among others, we have a problem with regard to stability. </p>
<p>And once you do that, of course, you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that any new change is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, in any direction. </p>
<p>There is a technical adjustment to our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> provisions, so the net profit for 2009 amounts to $ 2.253 billion. </p>
<p>We appreciate enormously the cooperation which has been established very rapidly in the case of Greece and also of course in other areas with the Commissioner and I think it was very good that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> cooperate confidently on this very important issue. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, I really <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that what we are doing is accompanying the markets ' return to normal functioning. </p>
<p>And that is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> I will make. </p>
<p>So I will be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent, and I will only say -- and I am not speaking for any particular country or issuer -- that I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have to continue working very seriously -- as we do -- at a global level and through the methodology that we have agreed upon, with the G20, the Financial Stability Board, the various working groups and working parties that we have created, to understand exactly the nature of the potential impact on global financial stability of the size of this hedge fund industry. </p>
<p>First, it pays very little attention to the conclusions of academic research concerning the fact that at around 2% you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> minimise the counterproductive effects of inflation. </p>
<p>On top of the 2% increase which would be the arithmetic consequence of such a measure, you would also have to pay a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium because, if you start changing inflation expectations dramatically, the market can expect further changes. </p>
<p>Fourth, in a period when we have to remain as credible, well-anchored and as regards the financial environment, as favourable to growth and to job creation as required, it is clear that creating an inflationary shock <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> trigger an accelerated inflation phenomenon, which would be very dangerous. </p>
<p>So I have absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that, all things being measured appropriately, Greece is in a much better state today, taking into account its activity and output, than it was before. </p>
<p>It is also, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, in the interests of the partners of the United States. </p>
<p>And, I repeat, we can not afford to return to a situation of financial <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> such as what we have been experiencing for two and a half years. </p>
<p>But I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this will form part of the effort which we have to make at a global level to ensure that the financial system is much more stable. </p>
<p>This is a highly leveraged and <span class='uncertainty'>speculative</span> industry. </p>
<p>Third, I think it would be very counterproductive in the present period of recovery, because it would have as an immediate consequence an increase in all medium and long-term interest rates, to incorporate the new inflation expectations, which would be <span class='uncertainty'>tentatively</span> 4% instead of less than 2% but close to 2%. </p>
<p>It is good to look at all ideas on <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> initiatives, but I have no particular comment at this stage. </p>
<p>That is my opinion and I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is the opinion of all central banks I know. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I can reassure you about credit itself because corporate lending is actually decreasing and consumer credit is increasing but only a little. </p>
<p>And as for monetary policy and interest rates, we are very careful to do what is necessary, without pre-commitment, without being obliged to behave in too lax a manner, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> on the contrary in too tough a manner, because we would have made a commitment previously. </p>
<p>And on the last point, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the decisions which have been taken by Greece at this stage are convincing. </p>
<p>All that being said, on growth you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also remember that we were more prudent and more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> than many observers, commentators and economists. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also say that there was unanimity for the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>On your second question, I will only say that by virtue of these convincing decisions taken by the Greek government, we all expect, and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we have already seen illustrations of this, that the credibility of the Greek government will increase, and that is the reason why we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it was absolutely necessary to take those decisions. </p>
<p>These decisions were taken on the basis of an overwhelming consensus and we judge them to be appropriate to the present circumstances, with the three-month operation returning to a <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender, but they were also taken with all the caution I mentioned in the introductory statement. </p>
<p>So what has been done is appropriate, we have no <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about that, and it has given full credibility to the programme that had already been decided upon, but which, prior to these decisions, was lacking credibility. </p>
<p>All that we have seen up to now confirms that we were wise to be prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>I myself spoke of a bumpy road, and I remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>With regard to our monetary policy stance, as you know, we never pre-commit, we always take the decision that we judge appropriate so that we are never trapped by a pre-commitment that would <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> not exactly appropriate later on. </p>
<p>For us, for the European Commission, for the peers, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>And if I can add a word in response to your question, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that if a fiscal consolidation programme is both credible and durable, it is going to help support economic growth over the medium term and also strengthen employment. </p>
<p>Let me add that I do not <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it would be appropriate to introduce the IMF as a supplier of help through standby arrangements or through any such kind of help. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the monetary policy stance, you know that it is not customary at all for me to comment on what the market <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not think. </p>
<p>So to summarise -LSB- in English of the above answer given in French -RSB-, we are far from having a credit bubble now, but we have to remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and alert in order to avoid having for too long a time the non-conventional measures that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be inappropriate in this respect. </p>
<p>First, we phased out the 12-month operations, then we phased out the six-month operations, and now the three-month operations are going back progressively to a <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> tender. </p>
<p>In our opinion, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are balanced, but it is clear that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> remains quite high and we see upside and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-04-08</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> it would be better if you put the question to those who will have to take the decision, and not us. </p>
<p>On a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> European Monetary Fund, I would just say that to use the adjective" monetary '' still <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> absolutely inappropriate to me. </p>
<p>As for the rest, I would say that this is one of the ideas proposed that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> be studied further by the working group that President van Rompuy is going to set up, in line with the decision of the Heads of State and Government. </p>
<p>The start of the activation of the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> loans is, as far as I understand, in the hands of the Greek government itself. </p>
<p>And we will be extraordinarily keen on having the executive branches of members of the euro area <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> the highest level of responsibility. </p>
<p>For central government bonds at investment grade level, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be Greek bonds or the bonds of any other country, by definition, we have said that the system of haircuts after the end of the year will be in practise the same as the system that we have today. </p>
<p>It will be hardened <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span>, for two reasons. </p>
<p>In any case, in July we will have an overall review of our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> situation. </p>
<p>What is changing is that instead of eliminating it at the end of the year, we will maintain the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for these investment-grade instruments still to be eligible as collateral. </p>
<p>For private instruments, it reinforces what exists today in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<p>I accept fully that the interpretation <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been then that for Greek bonds in particular it would have a consequence. </p>
<p>And <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give us credit for having defended the Stability and Growth Pact in all circumstances with extreme determination, including when the previous Chancellor of Germany was against it. </p>
<p>It was the worst <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> challenge for the world 's central banks since World War II, and it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been even worse. </p>
<p>We are eliminating part of what exists today, and we are also prolonging part of what exists today with a view to reinforcing <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<p>There will be other operations where we will, as we see it, improve our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<p>And thus far I have no reason to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it is not being implemented rigorously. </p>
<p>It is for public and private instruments at investment grade level, that we have taken this decision to prolong what exists today and to reinforce the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management of what exists today as regards, in particular, private securities. </p>
<p>So you are describing the normal preoccupation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management of a financial institution. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you be more precise? </p>
<p>I would only like to add that at the end of the year there will be a number of operations that are <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> today which will no longer be <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on the statement of the Heads of State and Government I would like to say that I consider it to be a workable statement that would -- in case it is needed -- make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to have joint efforts -- which are not subsidies, but loans without any element of subsidisation. </p>
<p>And we are, as you know, working actively on that in the Basel Committee, in the Financial Stability Board, in order to be as sure as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that we draw all the lessons from the present crisis. </p>
<p>It 's an additional <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> I make. </p>
<p>In a market economy banks -- commercial banks, banks in general -- have to analyse the various <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- public <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and private <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- being very careful not to take undue many <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So, it will be an improvement from the standpoint of our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<p>On your last point: we have confident and close relationship with the central banks of Hungary and Poland, and I will only say that it is, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>, up to them to say exactly what they want to say at this stage on the nature of our very close relationship. </p>
<p>I am very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and I do not draw any definitive conclusions at this stage, but the monthly flow in February was positive and we view this as a signal that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the situation <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> now be a little more favourable. </p>
<p>And in July we will say how we will apply the rules that will improve our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management in particular for private securities and private collateral. </p>
<p>And, as you know, the conditionality that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be imposed by the peers <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> even involve sanctions, which is something that is extremely strong and the best illustration of the fact that we share a common destiny in the euro area. </p>
<p>And we envisage taking decisions before the end of the year on those very important issues of new appropriate prudential rules and the necessary significant improvements in <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-05-06</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>As regards the three-month operation where we re-introduced the <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tender, I will only say that it is not our intention at all that the result of this tender would put the interest rate significantly higher than 1%. </p>
<p>We are responsible for the" M '' and we do our own work as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and I am speaking of course on behalf of the whole Governing Council. </p>
<p>Of course, today one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> consider that we have been vindicated in this defence. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that the President of the Commission of the time was saying that it was a stupid pact. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> also remember that several Heads of State and Government of the time, in particular the Chancellor of Germany and the President of the French Republic, were calling for it to be scrapped. </p>
<p>In this domain, as in many others, it is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a case of" the more competition, the better ''. </p>
<p>In any case, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is something which should be examined, again, not only in the European context, but also at the global level. </p>
<p>That is the reason why we consider that, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> recommend -- and it was a very important decision for us to take -- to the governments that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> step in and invest in the form of bilateral loans in the recovery of Greece. </p>
<p>And even today, we have had additional national figures, for instance, which were <span class='uncertainty'>unexpectedly</span> good. </p>
<p>So again, let 's remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, but we have very recently had some news that was better than expected. </p>
<p>We had a number of other points that were in the communiqué, so you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that we had to make some room for the new points. </p>
<p>I can say that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also sign that myself ! </p>
<p>We are working at this stage in Europe and at the global level on what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> avenues. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that Jürgen Stark also went to Athens with Commissioner Olli Rehn to follow what was going on in terms of the recovery programme. </p>
<p>I have already told you that, at the end of the year, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span>, of course, on ultimate adjustments, we will post average inflation over the first 12 years of the euro at a level which will be below, but close to, 2 per cent, i.e. exactly in line with the definition of price stability we gave twelve years ago. </p>
<p>I mentioned in my introductory remarks that we consider that, taking everything into account, we are currently seeing confirmation of the recovery in the euro area, even if growth <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be uneven. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-06-10</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>So, at this stage I would only say that we called on governments to <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> their responsibilities in a situation which was and is very demanding. </p>
<p>And it is important that we are all united in purpose, because we are all <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on global features, on the global economy and global inflation, in particular. </p>
<p>And to embark on personalisation does n't exactly <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> appropriate to me. </p>
<p>But what is important in what we say is the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>: we clearly are both as regards our own economy and as regards a large number of other industrialised economies, in a situation which remains <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>All things considered, if you take the two years, we have <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> the same level: the difference is 0.1%. </p>
<p>But we have in the first place to compare that with the alternative of doing nothing and what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen to the fiscal situation of those countries that would lead in a few years ' time to programmes that would have to be much harsher, much stricter, with all the consequences that that would have. </p>
<p>On your first question, I must confess that I did not see what President van Rompuy said, so I am very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>And that explains the fact that for the full year we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have this revision up, which is not totally negligible, because it is plus 0.2%. </p>
<p>It is a response also to your second question, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>In all circumstances, also when we face major difficulties, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it to have been extremely important that the anchoring of inflation expectations <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> work against inflation, but also -- in the period we experienced after the collapse of Lehman Brothers -- against the materialisation of inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As regards your second question, we are looking at all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> instruments, but there is absolutely nothing immediate in this domain. </p>
<p>We also said that they have to embark on issuance of new shares and stocks when <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and to have recourse to governments and to the recapitalisation options that were established in the past and are still necessary in a number of cases. </p>
<p>This is across the board and I would say a first step would be to exploit all the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> that the secondary legislation of Europe permits in all domains. </p>
<p>We have been saying for years and with a lot of strength that they have to improve their own balance sheets, they have to take every opportunity to put aside their earnings in order to reinforce their capital, and they have to be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> as regards remuneration. </p>
<p>Growth is not something that is already written <span class='uncertainty'>somewhere</span> and that is imposed on us: growth <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us, and, crucially, in our opinion, <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on confidence. </p>
<p>But you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that the first week we withdrew <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 16.5 billion euros, the second week 10 billion more, the third week an additional 8.5 billion, in the fourth week 5.5 billion. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-07-08</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>For further information, you will have to wait until 23 July, when you will have the stress tests, the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> and the results. </p>
<p>But again I remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>The exercise also envisages adverse conditions in financial markets and a shock on interest rates to capture an increase in <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia linked to deterioration in the EU government bond markets. </p>
<p>As far as we understand, it is the consequence of the decision of the banks themselves at the moment of the renewal of their previous financing to ask for less than they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have done. </p>
<p>On your first question, as you remember we decided that both the six-month and the one-year operation would be phased out, and that the three-month operation would be made with <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> rate tenders. </p>
<p>What is clear is that for reasons that are complex, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that a lot of important new information -- for instance all the positive decisions that have been taken, the fact that the various countries concerned have changed and improved their fiscal policies in comparison with what existed some months ago, in some cases some weeks ago, and the fact that a number of very important decisions have been taken by the European executive branches and by institutions such as the IMF -- is being progressively captured and incorporated by market participants, investors and savers in their own analysis. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we are observing this phenomenon. </p>
<p>The macroeconomic scenarios include a set of key macroeconomic <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> differentiated for the EU Member States, the rest of the EEA countries and the United States. </p>
<p>So, again, the fact that investors, savers and market participants are progressively incorporating this new information into their own decisions is something which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> natural. </p>
<p>On the stress tests, I would confirm that the ECB has been calling for the stress test to be as well-conducted as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, not only at the level of macro stress tests, as had been envisaged since a long period of time, but also at the level of individual banks. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember, the important decisions were taken at the level of the ECOFIN Council on 2 December 2009. </p>
<p>Again it is an ongoing phenomenon and I remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We place great emphasis on the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which characterises the present period, not only at our level but also at a global level. </p>
<p>We continue to observe the situation carefully, but for the present moment it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us appropriate. </p>
<p>On your second point, we have mentioned what was, in the eyes of the Governing Council, the appropriate way to respond to a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> need to increase capital and, of course, we expect all parties concerned, including governments and public authorities, to take that into account when the stress tests are published. </p>
<p>We already took the decision, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember, to have several successive three-month operations in that mode. </p>
<p>As has been done in the past on the other side of the Atlantic, in particular, we are trying to identify the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> themselves and to gain a proper understanding of extreme cases where there is severe deterioration in the situation. </p>
<p>On your second question we remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>On your first question on the stress tests, I do not know whether, implicitly, the banks that are talking to you are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that the stress tests should be much tougher -- not only to stress test the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that have already been identified, but all the very many <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that have not been identified. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> I am too impressed by the beauty of the play because I can not really make pertinent comparison. </p>
<p>If the banks had asked for more, we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have a lower level of market rates. </p>
<p>We are in a situation where a number of facts, figures and data do not confirm that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have stagnation or a double-dip recession. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> mention other figures, but I do not want to overburden you. </p>
<p>So, I see <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a tendency, not on our part -- because we remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and very prudent -- but outside the euro area, to be first excessively pessimistic about us, and to see that the figures we have do not confirm this pessimism. </p>
<p>It is one of those important decisions that I would categorise as being completely <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> ex-ante by observers, investors, savers and market participants. </p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that there is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the feeling that the euro area in particular, and Europe in general, is in a less favourable situation, I would draw your attention to the following: the second quarter in the euro area is likely to be significantly better than the first quarter. </p>
<p>So, we do n't <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the two, not at all. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember the first settlement week we had to withdraw liquidity at a level of $ 16.5 billion, the second settlement week $ 10 billion, the third $ 8.5 billion and then we went down to $ 5.5 billion. </p>
<p>We observe what is going on, and we are not surprised that the market is a little bit better because, as I have already said, decisions that are <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> are progressively incorporated ; they take a little time to be incorporated by market participants, investors and savers. </p>
<p>I would only say <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> the best team win. </p>
<p>You know the figures, and I have to say that part of the sentiment which is a little bit better <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> come from these facts that I have just mentioned. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-08-05</b>, 42 sentences</p></div><p>We remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>If, despite the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> we have experienced during the last few months and despite the very negative judgements that some participants in the market <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have had, wrongly of course, on the euro area and on Europe in general, the euro area prove able to surmount all these difficulties with no major or significant impact on the real economy as a result, I think part of the credit will come to the Governing Council of the ECB and we would be proud of that. </p>
<p>I think that the success of the stress tests has demonstrated that the Governing Council of the ECB was wise in recommending stress tests, in recommending the publication of the results at the level of individual banks and in recommending as much transparency as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And we were right not to declare victory, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember, because we then saw that the growth of the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were very modest. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we will have a good second quarter and that we will have a third quarter that will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be better than previously expected. </p>
<p>Markets would be totally upside down if they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not rely on solid, steady central banks. </p>
<p>We keep our composure as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in all circumstances. </p>
<p>So, the stress tests played a role, but we are in an environment that is also incorporating a number of other factors on top of the stress tests, such as the elements of the real economy that are better than expected and the decisions that have been taken by a number of countries that go in the right direction, as we had <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, in terms of resolute fiscal retrenchment and re-establishing their own credibility. </p>
<p>From time to time we really have to tell a number of market participants that they are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> wrong in their immediate assessment, what is the real situation in our view. </p>
<p>Of course, we have had recently good indications, from both hard data and soft data, and we consider that both the second quarter and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> also the third quarter are likely to be better than had been expected. </p>
<p>But there is another reason: I do not think that our fellow citizens will twice accept <span class='uncertainty'>risking</span> 27% of GDP of taxpayers ' money to support the financial system in order to avoid what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been a great depression. </p>
<p>We can not put ourselves in the situation that we faced in 2008, when the public authorities were obliged to take on a level of taxpayer <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that was absolutely gigantic and very abnormal. </p>
<p>And the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a depression in the future would remain high if we do not have a financial system which is sufficiently resilient. </p>
<p>So we have good news, but let us remain prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, and let us do all that we can to preserve confidence, to be the anchor of confidence that is so important in the present environment. </p>
<p>You know better than anyone that our environment can be <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> and it is up to us to provide an anchor not only for price stability, but for the confidence that is so necessary in Europe and also in the world, to the extent that we are an important participant in the global economy. </p>
<p>It is remarkable that throughout this recent period -- the three, four, five last months -- inflation expectations remained very solidly anchored despite the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, as evidenced by the information extracted from the financial markets and the information collected from the various surveys and panels. </p>
<p>It remains <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> and it remains uneven, as I said on behalf of the Governing Council, and we are in a situation where it is likely that the second semester will be much less buoyant than the second quarter, for which we expect to see flattering figures. </p>
<p>I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the contrary, taking into account the confidence channel and the fact that we are now, from that standpoint, in a situation which is obviously better than before. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that it is this very comprehensive set of information that has been captured by the market, and which signals that things are going back to normal progressively. </p>
<p>It is true that we expect the two last quarters of the second half of the year to be significantly less dynamic than the second quarter, because the second quarter <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be really exceptional. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that this confirmation that we will have a transition period was understood by the banks as something important. </p>
<p>If you remember the situation at that time, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> imagine that to some extent we have to take into account the period in question. </p>
<p>We do consider that we are in an environment of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>We are encouraging all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> means for the commercial banks to reinforce their balance sheets. </p>
<p>It is a remarkable track record, but as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember -- we took decisions in 2004, we took tough decisions in December 2005 -- which infuriated a large number of our counterparts ; and we even took decisions in 2008, in July, which was also during a period of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, which proved that we were not taking our responsibility of delivering price stability lightly. </p>
<p>And the market has understood that pretty well, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>As regards the recapitalisation and elements that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> permit the banks to reinforce their balance sheets, we are very clear on that. </p>
<p>On the contrary, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that this was an early judgement, which was wrong, and that there is now a feeling that it is an important step forward. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on our forecast at this stage, I would not change in any respect the <span class='uncertainty'>predictions</span> that we made last time. </p>
<p>Well, again, it is our function to be anchors of stability, also in an environment which is <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>As regards households, we see that the dynamism of loans to households <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be confirmed, at 2.8%. </p>
<p>We are not over-interpreting these results and we should not declare victory, but certainly they do not confirm or <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a credit crunch. </p>
<p>That being said, in the figures for June loans to non-financial corporations over twelve months were at -1.9%, which is a little less negative than in the previous month and up to now <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us to be in line with historical observations after a recession of the size that we experienced, unfortunately, in the previous year. </p>
<p>Again, the main message is: we remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>We are very prudent, <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and modest. </p>
<p>I would say that I have been central bank governor for <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 17 years. </p>
<p>So, regarding the overall monetary and financial environment of the real economy, I am not sure that you can <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that it is tighter than was the case before. </p>
<p>I said that if it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span>, ex post -- which has yet to be proved -- that we have been able to pass through this difficult period without the real economy being very significantly, negatively influenced, which was the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of a large number of observers, then <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> part of the credit <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> come to the central bank. </p>
<p>As regards the money market, we see this market functioning a little bit better -- the volume of transactions in the overall money market has increased significantly, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even doubled. </p>
<p>The Governing Council considers today the present monetary policy rate to be appropriate and there are no signs at the moment <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> us to change interest rates. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> put the question directly to the central bank in question and to the supervisory authority in question, because both the central bank and the supervisory authority were at the meeting in Basel. </p>
<p>Regarding the results of the bank lending survey, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the period of the survey was not the best period, because it was done between 14 June and 2 July 2010. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-09-02</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>This figure is much better than that <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> a year ago. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have observed, there was no pre-announcement of any interest rate increases in the past when we took the same technical decisions for other durations. </p>
<p>It is our hope that we will proceed as rapidly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> with this market normalisation, which should be part of the normalisation of the overall situation. </p>
<p>We consider that we are still in an <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> universe. </p>
<p>We firmly <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this. </p>
<p>Our decisions today, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, are appropriate and commensurate with the situation that we are observing. </p>
<p>All this explains why our staff has <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> projections significantly upward in comparison with the June projections, not only for this year, but also for the next, because of the carry-over. </p>
<p>As regards your first question on the money markets, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen, we have taken a set of measures today. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, again, the Governing Council must remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent: we do not declare victory. </p>
<p>And I have confidence that they will manage this difficult issue as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, as they did in the past. </p>
<p>When I said that the Governing Council was of the view that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are" slightly tilted '' to the upside, it was in comparison with the inflation projections themselves which are fully in line with price stability. </p>
<p>We have guarded the euro area from inflation as well as from deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> materialising. </p>
<p>We consider that by ensuring price stability -- price stability meaning less than, but close to two percent -- we are guarding against inflation and against the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation, which never materialised. </p>
<p>Such diversity <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be a normal feature of a very vast economy. </p>
<p>I will be soon in Estonia and we will have the opportunity to review everything, but at this moment in time I would say that the preparations <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be very much on track, and we are satisfied with that. </p>
<p>As regards your second question on debt reduction, I mentioned the fact that in the past it has proven <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to go from very high levels as a proportion of GDP to sustainable levels. </p>
<p>To start with your second question I think it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> also very much on you as well and how you communicate our message. </p>
<p>Instead we said: now we are in black figures ; it is better, but let us remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-10-07</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>What is being implemented in Greece today <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to us absolutely of the essence and, in our opinion, has to be executed in a very attentive fashion. </p>
<p>Again, all <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the situation we see on our own market and whether or not we judge that it is appropriate to continue to help restore the more appropriate functioning of our monetary policy transmission channel. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Germany, because of its international position, was also touched, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more than others, by the collapse of the global economy. </p>
<p>Excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability, which is something we will be able to exchange views on with the authorities - central bank governors and ministers of finance - of the major floating currencies in Washington over the next few days. </p>
<p>This is not a new message -- it is a message that the ECB constantly conveys through all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> channels, including, of course, directly to Ministers of Finance when the Vice-President and I participate in the Eurogroup meetings. </p>
<p>First of all, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that Greece benefited from extraordinary aid from the other countries and is already activating extraordinary aid. </p>
<p>The non-standard measures have to be commensurate with the functioning of the markets: if we have disruption here, or and <span class='uncertainty'>anomaly</span> in the functioning of some markets there, we have to cope with it to get a more normal transmission of our monetary policy impulses. </p>
<p>My message will be the same as my answer to your question: excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. </p>
<p>I draw again your attention to the following: we consider that the non-standard measures and the standard measures must not be <span class='uncertainty'>confused</span>. </p>
<p>This decision of 19 June has been reaffirmed by the Chinese Government, and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this will be positive for growth in China and for balanced growth at a global level. </p>
<p>The aim of the programme, as I have already said several times, is to help the monetary policy transmission mechanism to function as correctly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It has been confirmed by all the international institutions, and the IMF itself is <span class='uncertainty'>revising</span> growth in Europe upwards. </p>
<p>It is designed in particular to permit the monetary policy transmission channel to function as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It is natural, in a wide economy such as ours, with 16 countries and 330 million people, that you have <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuations</span> and cycles corresponding to an idiosyncratic situation. </p>
<p>Year after year, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the various countries involved, we are gaining several -- more or fewer -- months of life expectancy. </p>
<p>First of all, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen that we have embarked on an exercise of concision, because we had observed that, after a certain period of time, the ` literary exercise ' of the Introductory Statement resulted in longer texts. </p>
<p>When we address the global economy, we do, of course, incorporate the biggest economy in the world, and I do not think there is any message that we wanted to convey to qualify differently what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen in the United States of America. </p>
<p>We consider that we have to remain very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and very prudent. </p>
<p>On the one hand, excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the exchange rates of the major free-floating currencies has adverse implications. </p>
<p>Let me only say that, in assessing the situation, we have to be very careful to always remain <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>We were prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Volatility</span> is part of the world as it functions, and we have to continue to have a sense of direction and a sense of the medium or medium to long-term perspective, which is never as good or as bad as the immediate judgment <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>. </p>
<p>On the second question, we and supervisors in all countries are calling on all banks to be extremely attentive to their <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management. </p>
<p>I 'm taking advantage of all the Greek questions, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> also the Irish questions, to re-state that we are an institution that is responsible for price stability at the level of sixteen countries -- and as of 1 January next year, seventeen countries -- with the size comparable to the United States of America. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see precisely this progressive phasing-out taking place over the last few days. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-11-04</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>So yes, we are constantly reflecting on what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be done, but I have no decision to announce to you right now. </p>
<p>We are already, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say, a monetary federation. </p>
<p>We are in a position where we feel, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more intensively, the importance of having the economic union functioning as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We opposed and expressed our grave concerns publicly in 2005 when the Stability and Growth Pact was <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span>. </p>
<p>Before answering your question I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that at the last press conference you asked me a question on the pension reforms and I would just like to confirm what I said last time, namely that we approve the pension reform in France. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen what the market literature was saying. </p>
<p>So, because we did not change our rates -LRB- neither the MRO nor the deposit rate was changed -RRB-, what we have observed in the market is that the positioning of EONIA, the very short-term rates, is <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the decisions of the banks themselves. </p>
<p>It is a kind of equilibrium which <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on what the banks themselves are asking for, and you can see that it goes up and down from time to time, very much <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the demand from the banks themselves. </p>
<p>It also indicates that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the EONIA means more today than it meant before, because before <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> only a very small fraction of the institutions had access to this very low interest rate refinancing. </p>
<p>It prevents both inflationary and deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> from materialising. </p>
<p>As regards our own framework and the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> decisions that we will take, bearing in mind what we have always said, which I repeated today on behalf of the Governing Council, the non-standard measures that we have taken are, by definition, of a transitory nature. </p>
<p>This would avoid the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that such a permanent scheme would induce ex ante loose policies, and this is very important. </p>
<p>It can be, but it is not the ex-ante compulsory <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>The IMF does not make necessarily the ex-ante working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the relationship with markets, investors and savers is interrupted. </p>
<p>I will just say that it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the majority of observers had the decision very much in their minds. </p>
<p>In our view, all features of this new scheme should be designed both to induce the soundest policies -- and in this respect, you measure the importance of all that we have said on the automaticity of the surveillance process itself, which we judge to be very important -- and to help effectively to avoid systemic financial <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span>. </p>
<p>Of course, it can never be excluded, but this <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is not made as compulsory ex ante. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Depending</span> on the period under consideration, the proportion <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be the following: in more than 75% of cases there was no such interruption of the normal relationship and only in less than 25% of cases there was. </p>
<p>I will certainly not embark on disentangling the various factors that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have played a role. </p>
<p>I have no reason not to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> them, and again I trust their statement that it is in the interest of the United States to have a strong dollar, strong vis-à-vis the other major floating currencies, including the euro. </p>
<p>I would say the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> made is the contrary. </p>
<p>I was wondering if <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it indirectly meant that in his own constituency from time to time verbal discipline <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be appropriate. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2010-12-02</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>I mention that because from time to time observers are <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> losing the sense of what is going on in the real economy. </p>
<p>I say that, but for me your question is interesting because I also have to say, as you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see today, that since the start of the recovery, which began in the third quarter of last year, we have been constantly surprised on the upside by what we have been observing. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that we have a good" M ''. </p>
<p>I trust that we will remain in permanent contact with the authorities in question, namely the governments, so that they can demonstrate as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that they are living up to their own responsibilities. </p>
<p>At the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, it was very clear that we were able to contain the pressure because we all had authority as public authorities. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> confidence is always regained progressively, so it is up to the responsible authorities, and I am sure that they will act to redress the situation progressively. </p>
<p>We had envisaged that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> return to tenders. </p>
<p>Excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is not welcome, as you know. </p>
<p>We are telling all countries, without exception, to implement as completely and convincingly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> all the measures necessary for them to attain the fiscal goals that have been fixed for next year. </p>
<p>I appreciate enormously the fact that they <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have delivered price stability in a way that is historically impressive. </p>
<p>So we have <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> our projections upwards, and the results, when they have come in, have been a little better or substantially better than what we were expecting and what international institutions were expecting. </p>
<p>I have been asking for a" quantum leap '' on behalf of the Governing Council, in order for both the Stability and Growth Pact itself, which monitors fiscal policies, and for macro policy surveillance, the surveillance of competitive indicators, the surveillance of imbalances to be given a legal basis and to be as strong as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It was a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<p>Our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that we will return to normal functioning. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> cite other big advanced economies that are in this category. </p>
<p>They are broadly balanced overall, taking into account all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside and all the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the downside, and also taking into account, as you have <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> seen that we consider the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the real economy to be slightly on the downside. </p>
<p>We had a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of either going back to the normal tenders or maintaining these non-standard measures, which is to have the full allotment. </p>
<p>And I trust that if you were to ask a question which would try to check whether it is a real question or a fancy question, you would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> see that nobody really thinks that it is a real question. </p>
<p>As you have seen, our projections are <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that we are going to have significant growth over the coming years. </p>
<p>I repeat what I just said about the SMP, which is ongoing and which is observed closely by the markets: it is designed to permit the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> transmission of our monetary policy under the present circumstances. </p>
<p>On your first question, all vast continental economies such as the euro area and the United States have a degree of <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> in the growth rates of the different states or countries, <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> in their unit labour costs, <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> in their inflation rates and so forth -- even <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> as regards unemployment. </p>
<p>But those of you who are the most lucid will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> see that you would be wise to take everything into account when making your own judgements, including the information I have just given, which is a little bit of an underestimation in my opinion. </p>
<p>We had two <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> -- they were obviously open -- and we decided, as you know now, to maintain this full allotment fixed interest rate. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> surprise some observers -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> it is not exactly the way they see it. </p>
<p>As regards your first question, it is true that we consider that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced when we look at the medium-term <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>By the way, I said this to the Members of the European Parliament in Brussels two days ago, and I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see the extent to which, as representatives of the European people, they appreciate the fact that we delivered our primary mandate over the first twelve years. </p>
<p>I think that this indicates as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> the Governing Council 's position. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-01-13</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>There have been questions in past press conferences on whether we considered the double-dip an important <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and I was relatively prudent, but positive. </p>
<p>It is a way to correct what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> otherwise significantly hamper growth. </p>
<p>There are four <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>: we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> withdraw the non-standard measures while decreasing or increasing the interest rates. </p>
<p>If I take the recent Purchasing Managers ' Index -LRB- PMI -RRB- and the European Commission survey of the industrial sector, we have seen improvements, and I expect that the hard data to come will confirm the soft data <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that production was quite good. </p>
<p>Regarding your second question, fiscal consolidation makes it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to regain the appropriate creditworthiness and reinforces confidence by clearly demonstrating to economic agents, savers and investors that things are going in the right direction. </p>
<p>And we also welcomed the commitment of the Irish authorities to take any further measures that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme. </p>
<p>You have to correct a little, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> here and there, there was a slight disappointment. </p>
<p>This is important, and it is <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on our monetary policy stance and the transmission of this monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>The non-standard measures are there to help the transmission of the standard measures in the best way <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the circumstances. </p>
<p>Everything <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the capacity of all countries concerned to be" ahead of the curve ''. </p>
<p>In 2007, in the period of the start of financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> we were the first to embark on non-standard measures, on 9 August 2007. </p>
<p>Looking ahead, we feel that inflation rates <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> temporarily increase further and go over and above the 2% level before falling back to what we consider to be price stability towards the end of the year. </p>
<p>This is the reason why we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the decisions that have been taken will progressively help to move things in the right direction. </p>
<p>Naturally, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> enormously, on the prices of energy and commodities. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go through all countries and the comparisons would all be flattering for us. </p>
<p>As regards your first question on the ECB, let me only say that the issue of a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> insolvency of the ECB is absurd. </p>
<p>We were at the maximum level of provisioning, so we thought it was time to increase the capital in order to enable us to continue to make the appropriate provisioning in view of the increased <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of foreign exchange rates, the interest rate <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we - and all central banks of the world - have, the increased <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the gold price and all kinds of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, including credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have. </p>
<p>So: we take decisions regarding the non-standard measures independently from the decisions that we take in relation to the interest rates to help restoring a more normal transmission of our monetary policy decision, being commensurate with the disruption or <span class='uncertainty'>anomalies</span> that we are observing in some market segments. </p>
<p>And my feeling is that the gross divergences which peaked in 2009 declined <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> in 2010. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have taken unemployment also, and you would be surprised to see that the unemployment level differences in the states in the United States are not that different from what we are also observing in Europe. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that we mentioned Ireland in our last introductory statement. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have to do this or that in the future, but I do not confirm anything. </p>
<p>So, if you look at the evolution of this" standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> '', it has diminished in 2010 and we expect a further decline of this dispersion in 2011 and 2012. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> maintain or increase the non-standard measures while increasing or decreasing the interest rates. </p>
<p>These non-standard measures are there to allow the transmission of the monetary policy of the ECB to be as effective as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in the circumstances. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-02-03</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>As you know, we are supplying one-week, one-month and three-month liquidity on a full allotment basis and we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see some technical factors recently explaining why the overnight interest rates were going quite high. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have, at other moments, very low levels of inflation. </p>
<p>I will not say anything on the decision we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take in the weeks to come, and in particular next time. </p>
<p>So, this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> explain what we have observed. </p>
<p>It is this set of tensions that you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> regard as a crisis. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have, from time to time, higher levels of inflation. </p>
<p>We are drawing all the lessons we can from the crisis at the global level, in the United States, in Europe, in other advanced economies and certainly also in the rest of the world, in the emerging world, with the idea that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> minimise the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of unfolding of such a crisis through the appropriate strengthening of macro-prudential policies, through the appropriate improvement of rules, regulations, standards and codes in global finance, through the emergence of institutions designed specifically to look at systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and macro-prudential policies - this is now the case, as you know, on both sides of the Atlantic - and through the appropriate coordination of economic and financial macro-level policies with a view to having macro-policies that will avoid imbalances and abnormally loose, unsound behaviour. </p>
<p>It has been a crisis which has been the worst since the Second World War and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been the worst since the First World War had we not ourselves and the other central banks -- we were on the front line - not decided to act in a very short span of time, and had governments not also decided to adopt very important measures. </p>
<p>So, from that standpoint, what we have observed in the most recent period has been a <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuation</span> of interest rates which was due to the fact that there is a better functioning market. </p>
<p>So, we take the appropriate decision on the interest rates ; then we look at what is or is not necessary to help restore the monetary policy transmission mechanism as correctly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>But that being said, your other question was:" Was it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to avoid the crisis? '' </p>
<p>On your first question, I would say the money market <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be showing signs of better functioning. </p>
<p>This is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> needs to be mentioned in the overall balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation. </p>
<p>On your second question, I would only say that these new stress tests are being prepared in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> by the appropriate bodies, and we are following that very very carefully -- to the extent that we at the ECB are concerned. </p>
<p>At the moment, we consider inflation expectations to be firmly anchored, but of course we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent. </p>
<p>As regards the decision that will be taken by governments in respect of the EFSF and, tomorrow, the permanent fund, we call for the utilisation of the EFSF to be as flexible as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and as effective as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in terms of magnitude. </p>
<p>In answer to your first question it is certainly not out of the question that the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be different. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the global diagnosis on Europe and on the euro area has gradually incorporated what I have just said, namely that one has to consider the fundamentals. </p>
<p>It is clear that when we address the issue of the remaining <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> regarding the real economy, we are thinking of a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> global phenomenon that would be counterproductive in terms of real activity. </p>
<p>As regards price stability, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I invite you to our next meeting because then we will have the medium-term projections and will be able to assess the situation better. </p>
<p>By that I mean the fundamentals of the currency, which has kept its value over 12 years remarkably and better than any currency at any time over the last 50 years, and the fundamentals of the consolidated economy, with its broadly balanced current account, a single economy with a single currency which overall has an annual public finance deficit which for 2011 is <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> half that of other major industrialised economies. </p>
<p>We also consider the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of adverse developments in the European financial system stemming from the tensions that we are currently observing. </p>
<p>On the question of whether it was judged that there was very significant under-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, under-pricing of spreads and underestimation of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia in global finance in general before the start of the crisis, even before the start of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, this was certainly <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are following the present geopolitical tensions with extreme attention: it is our duty ; there are <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> repercussions, and we remain permanently alert to the extent that it has an impact on our primary mandate and an impact on the functioning of our monetary policy transmission. </p>
<p>I do not want to comment on slight changes that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> observe when we extract information from markets as it is not really pertinent. </p>
<p>We consider that fiscal consolidation is not at <span class='uncertainty'>variance</span> with the consolidation of the recovery, with growth and job creation on a sustainable medium-term basis, because fiscal consolidation brings about confidence, and confidence is the ingredient which is lacking the most in a number of economies. </p>
<p>I made the point in January 2007 before the start of the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, that we were observing general under-pricing of spreads and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, general underestimation of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia and very low -- abnormally low -- levels of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in global finance. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-03-03</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>We had said already in January and February that the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> emerging from the economic analysis <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> move on the upside. </p>
<p>As you know, the standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> of growth between the states of the United States is of the same order of magnitude as the standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> of growth of the countries in the euro area. </p>
<p>But what is extremely important for a central bank is to be sure that everybody understands that the anchoring of inflation expectations remains excellent and that nobody, economic agents or price-setters -- not only the social partners, but all price-setters -- can make the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that, in the medium run, there would be a permanently high level of inflation. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> look at the past. </p>
<p>To sum up our message, it is that you have to put yourself in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> situation because everything relies upon the governments themselves. </p>
<p>And that is something which we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is absolutely essential. </p>
<p>What we are saying when we speak of" automaticity '' is, in particular, that the excessive deficit procedure should start as automatically as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in order to avoid interference, with all the considerations involved, which has proved in the past to be extremely counterproductive. </p>
<p>That is the way we operate and you have a clear demonstration today of the separation principle because we are maintaining the non-standard measures as they were in the first quarter and, at the same time, we indicate that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> change the standard measures. </p>
<p>I do not exclude anything, including, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that the Commission <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take legal action. </p>
<p>As regards your first question, firstly an interest rate increase at the next meeting is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, but it is not certain. </p>
<p>On our website you have our opinion and you have a summary of our opinion in ten points that are the points of particular importance, including in particular automaticity -- as much automaticity as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- in the procedure for excessive deficits and for the sanctions, a judgement on the fiscal and economic situation which is as independent as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and so forth. </p>
<p>We have judged today that this balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has moved on the upside and that is why we expressed our strong vigilance. </p>
<p>We mentioned that we are being very vigilant and my understanding of the position of the Governing Council -- fully in line with assessments made in the past - is that an increase in interest rates at the next meeting is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that your question was more or less mixing up two things. </p>
<p>I do not deny that we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have influence when we meet in the various" Gs '', including in the G20 and in the international meetings. </p>
<p>Our decision will - as always - be taken by the Governing Council and will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on any new information and data we receive. </p>
<p>The stakes are enormous and inflation at a global level -- not only at the level of the euro area -- as well as the stability and prosperity of the global economy <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on these prices being appropriate. </p>
<p>So, it is not certain but it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>I will not say anything on the timing of <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> changes as regards the persistent bidders. </p>
<p>The issues we are speaking about are associated with the signature of governments themselves and so governments should do their own job as well as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, apply and implement fully what they are committed to do and be ahead of the curve. </p>
<p>Given my own understanding of the attitude of the Governing Council, we have expressed our judgement as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-04-07</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>As I said, interest rates are low, and when people borrow, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the country: some are borrowing on a short-term basis, others on a medium-term basis or a long-term basis. </p>
<p>Furthermore, according to all projections, the public finance deficit for this year will be <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> half that of other advanced economies, namely Japan or the United States. </p>
<p>But this <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on us and <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the fact that everybody recognises that we will do what is necessary to deliver price stability. </p>
<p>On the global growth rate, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see the immediate impact on the global PMI for instance. </p>
<p>When I referred to the fact that we had ample liquidity which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> materialise in some kind of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability, I was referring not to the present increase of the outstanding monetary aggregates, but the hangover that had been accumulated before the crisis. </p>
<p>And that is why we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we are directly and indirectly helping all countries, but especially those that most need to be in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> environment. </p>
<p>I would say that the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the EONIA today is lower than the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> observed previously. </p>
<p>Because what is important, is to go back to the market as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So, we have a very strong message for banks: to do what is necessary to put themselves in a situation as healthy as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to be able, of course, to do their job, which is to finance the real economy. </p>
<p>And that is the reason why we call on both the sovereign and the banks to take all appropriate measures to consolidate, preserve and, where necessary, improve significantly their own credibility, because everything <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the confidence that market investors and savers have in the sovereign and in the banks themselves. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the market has understood that these were important decisions. </p>
<p>We should not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the rate of growth of the monetary aggregate and the overhang, the stock. </p>
<p>I mentioned as a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> the combination of the Japanese event, particularly its nuclear aspect, with what happens in the Middle East and in North Africa, because all this clearly combines to create <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It is extremely important because we are all intimately intertwined and because the long and medium-term interest rate markets crucially <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the level of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>But we have to be realistic and when I was mentioning <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, I explicitly mentioned the associated <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for us from this dramatic natural event through the global economy. </p>
<p>So, I am sure that these reforms are <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> by the observers and by everybody in Spain. </p>
<p>That is the reason why we are so strong in calling for appropriate governance, in calling for the reinforcement of governance by all means <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and in calling on governments to fulfil their responsibilities and to have a sense of direction. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-05-05</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>It would be good if it were confirmed that the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the EONIA is now less pronounced than before. </p>
<p>We are obviously looking at the behaviour of our banks, which are asking for <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> less liquidity in our own refinancing operations. </p>
<p>We apply a plan, and the plan is, as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, to get the country concerned into a situation in which it has a primary surplus in its own fiscal position. </p>
<p>It is our judgement that there are upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> see in March this year, market expectations were that we would not increase rates at any point during the year. </p>
<p>I must be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> because these decisions have to be taken by the appropriate bodies, including the IMF, but, as far as I understand, what is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> envisaged, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the decision of each particular institution, would be a contribution from the IMF of one third and a contribution from the Europeans of two thirds. </p>
<p>If there is anything we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do to continue to reinforce our cooperation, we will certainly do it and we are in permanent contact with Masaaki Shirakawa. </p>
<p>Our present analysis was explained clearly a moment ago and I repeat:" With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability ''. </p>
<p>In the contribution from the Europeans you have to take into account the fact that we have two bodies, the EFSF and the EFSM, which, as has been the case before, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> each contribute one third, so the two thirds would be shared between the EFSF and the EFSM. </p>
<p>On 27 April 2011, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System said that the Federal Reserve System <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> that a strong and stable dollar is both, in the American interest and in the interest of the global economy. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you repeat that question, please? </p>
<p>However, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that we observed in the EONIA 's behaviour on certain occasions in the past has reduced quite significantly and we have taken note of this. </p>
<p>We feel that fiscal balances <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> fall behind the targets agreed by the ECOFIN Council, and, you know, there is monitoring of all countries according to the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>Again, we were unanimous today, as we were unanimous, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember when we increased rates in our last meeting. </p>
<p>We see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the downside. </p>
<p>And as regards the average, as I have said, we see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the economy of the euro area as a whole as being broadly balanced. </p>
<p>But from this perspective, the recovery has, to date, been confirmed without too much <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>I also had the opportunity -- and you were a witness, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me -- to welcome him at the Bundesbank itself when there was the" passing of the baton '', between Axel and Jens. </p>
<p>We have to remain very prudent and <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>We also see that, since the start of the recovery, when we have corrected our projections every quarter we have <span class='uncertainty'>tended</span> to increase them. </p>
<p>So there is nothing new or special that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> mention in this respect. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> had an additional reason to think it was useful, given that we are issuing a currency for what are now 17 different countries, and this calls for appropriate unification of communication. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-06-09</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>And it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that there is a good understanding at the moment, given the anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Here, we consider that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are balanced, so we have <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> the same weight of the upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and of the downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As regards this <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a catastrophe, if I understand it well, and that losses <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be registered and so forth, the position of the Governing Council is based on very serious reasons and general principles. </p>
<p>First of all, I would say that it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on the country itself. </p>
<p>The staff of the Eurosystem is forecasting that overall growth this year will or <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be -LRB- because we have to be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> -RRB- 0.3% higher than in the last assessment in the projections of the ECB staff. </p>
<p>But more generally it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me that verbal discipline is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> appropriate in the present circumstances and I am speaking of the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>In that respect Ireland has the benefit of an economy which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me more flexible than others. </p>
<p>Of course, in the present circumstances in particular, everything that can go in this direction would certainly <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be appropriate, without entering into details of the measures. </p>
<p>As regards the global economy, as I said earlier, we are in a period marked by a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, and I think that we have to be fully aware of that. </p>
<p>Second, the euro area will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> post -- at the end of the year -- a public finance deficit in the order of magnitude of 4.5% of GDP or less, when Japan and the United States will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be in-between 9.5% and 10%. </p>
<p>By mentioning the Governing Council 's posture of strong vigilance, I would say that, as you already know, it means that we are in a mode where there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be an increase in rates at the next meeting, but we are never pre-committed. </p>
<p>In response to the rest of your question, it is good to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent regarding sensitive matters and I would not comment in particular on Ireland. </p>
<p>I would also say that there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside, as well as <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the downside, so after due meditation, in the assessment of the Governing Council, we see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> balanced in this respect, as regards the real economy. </p>
<p>And, it also <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the overall environment and this is a consideration which is also of extreme importance. </p>
<p>And I have also said that there was a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which is an important part of the picture. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that profoundly and it was also the case for Wim Duisenberg and our first team in the Executive Board, it is now and will be the case with Mario Draghi and the team. </p>
<p>When the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated, you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> remember that several countries were calling for simultaneous advances in terms of political union. </p>
<p>Finally the private sector involvement that everybody would prefer would be to go back as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to spontaneous private sector market financing. </p>
<p>Let 's not forget that the countries concerned have the immense responsibility to cope with their own problems and demonstrate as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to all partners and observers that the programme is working. </p>
<p>I said that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> then reflect on tomorrow, and that tomorrow would call for changes to the Treaty, that tomorrow would allow the centre to replace, in terms of decision-making in a number of domains, national governments that were in a difficult situation. </p>
<p>It would necessarily be something which will be profoundly original, because it would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be a new type of confederation of sovereign states. </p>
<p>Again, we have a job to do today, and I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that if we all live up to our responsibilities and have a solid sense of direction, we will succeed -- as we have succeeded remarkably in our monetary union since the setting-up of the euro. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the people. </p>
<p>I will not embark on any kind of <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> on" what happens if '', because I am working on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the right decisions will be taken, not the wrong. </p>
<p>That is my <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>On the United States, I am of course working on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that they will have no default. </p>
<p>Now, again, we are <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on our people -- the people of Europe. </p>
<p>But I quoted Jean Monnet, saying" Nobody can say today what will be the institutional framework of Europe tomorrow because the future changes, which will be fostered by today 's changes, are <span class='uncertainty'>unpredictable</span>. '' </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-07-07</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, we <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> contemplate going further. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the wisdom of those who have important decisions to take. </p>
<p>We are encouraging a solution that goes as far as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in reinforcing governance, without, because it is the rule of the game at the moment, necessitating a change to the Treaty. </p>
<p>It is also clear that a small group, a small oligopolistic structure, is not what is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> desirable at the level of global finance. </p>
<p>Today I mention again, on behalf of the Governing Council, this elevated <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which is a mark of the times, and, as you remember, we were very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> and prudent during the whole period since the start of the recovery. </p>
<p>We said that, in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the upside or on the downside ; we do not see a bias ; we see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> as being balanced as regards growth for the euro area, within the context of general <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>This is true even when we say that we are in a mode of" strong vigilance '', which has significance in terms of the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> happen. </p>
<p>Again, you can not eliminate a failure, eliminate a drama, but you can not <span class='uncertainty'>presume</span> that it is a normal situation to have this kind of private sector involvement. </p>
<p>The default or selective default <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a consequence of some of the actions and then we would say:" No, it is not what we would consider appropriate in the circumstances ''. </p>
<p>And taking into account the fact that there are big advantages in having a large set of private authorities, private institutions and private participants in global finance that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> challenge their views and not exert an overwhelming influence, but all that being said, I would say, it 's work in progress and it would be a little bit naïve to think that we have a clear cut solution and the solution is easy to apply. </p>
<p>On the third point, I have, on behalf of the Governing Council, emphasised the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> quite a lot in the last month. </p>
<p>We are following the interaction with the banks in the three countries that have programmes very <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span> and very attentively because they are all part of the overall programme that had been negotiated. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Uncertainty</span> surrounds the prospects not only for European growth but also for global growth. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you repeat your last question? </p>
<p>The EBA is responsible for these tests, but we have also been involved, providing some <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>We are not using this working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> you remind me of the first one? </p>
<p>But again, we publish ranges and these ranges allow us to capture existing <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> much better, taking into account all the parameters that have an influence on the consumer price index. </p>
<p>So, we are giving our own advice to governments as clearly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> on the subject of private sector involvement, namely:" Do n't depart from the global doctrine. </p>
<p>Then you are financing the adjustment with a view to going back to normal creditworthiness and normal market financing as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> thanks to the rigorous implementation of the adjustment programme. </p>
<p>On your last question, when a country is determined to practise cost monitoring in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in order to regain competitiveness -LRB- and do n't forget that at the start of the euro Germany had a current account deficit and a low level of competitiveness considerably hampered by reunification -RRB-, when a country is very attentive to its costs, when nominal costs and prices evolve in a sound and orderly manner over time, you obtain the ensuring benefits, and the benefits are growth, as well as diminishing unemployment and increased employment. </p>
<p>So, you should not deduce from the fact that our projections were below but close to 2% in the medium term, at least in this horizon, that we do not need to increase rates simply because such increases, as <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> by the markets, were incorporated in this projection. </p>
<p>And then you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> all see market expectations sharply changing, as this is normal on the basis of the information given by the Governing Council of the ECB. </p>
<p>And I would also say that when you run sound policies and improve competitiveness you not only have growth and jobs, but you also have resilience, which is demonstrated by the fact that the German success has taken place during the worst crisis since the Second World War, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been the worst since the First World War. </p>
<p>So you have a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> exception to the rule at the global level. </p>
<p>I also noted -- this was not a decision which went beyond what had already been decided -- that 80% of the Portuguese parliament approved the adjustment programme, which is something I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> to be very important. </p>
<p>As regards the so-called" global doctrine '', the <span class='uncertainty'>presumption</span> of the international community is that if you have a particular country problem, you do what is necessary to have a very, very strong and credible conditionality which is part of the global doctrine with the adjustment programme negotiated by the IMF. </p>
<p>We have called for this to be done in the best, most professional fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And this is <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the wisdom, determination and courage of all those who have responsibilities in this area -- on it being corrected in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Next time, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> we agree that we all concentrate on the first part, on our monetary policy which is much more, I would say, important than some of you suspect. </p>
<p>And the fact that we have, at the same time, difficulties in some countries such that there are significant <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia can not in any respective make us forget that the solid foundations underlying the functioning of the euro area are precisely the stability and the confidence that we are preserving. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-08-04</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>But I have absolutely no information and it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me absurd to be frank. </p>
<p>That being said, I would say that all the information we have on the implementation of the adjustment programme in Ireland <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that it is going in the right direction. </p>
<p>It is true that we are going through a period of a high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, not only in the euro area, but at the global level. </p>
<p>As regards the EFSF, it is a decision which I have accepted on behalf of the Governing Council that when the EFSF intervenes in a secondary market, it would be on the basis of an ECB analysis recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to financial stability. </p>
<p>That 's the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of the Governing Council, which trusts the signature of the 17 heads. </p>
<p>That is absolutely obvious and was seen by all observers, no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>But, as I have said, there is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> at the European and euro area level, and there is also <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> at the level of the world economy. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> and have come to the assessment that, given the renewed tensions that we are observing in some financial markets, it was the right and appropriate response. </p>
<p>This is the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> of the ECB 's Governing Council in terms of guaranteeing stability, the financial stability, which is a responsibility of governments of the euro area. </p>
<p>One is our own analysis, recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to financial stability. </p>
<p>Of particular importance are the commitments undertaken, and I have mentioned that in the introductory statement: delivering on their fiscal policy, the improvement of governance and of the surveillance of various countries, the re-affirmation that they will all honour their signatures and the flexibility that they have decided upon regarding the EFSF and the ESM, given the various areas where they have decided to create additional capacity, including interventions on the secondary market through the EFSF which should, in our view, become operational as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>As regards the United States, of course I am happy that a solution has been found, and I had no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that a solution would be found. </p>
<p>Particularly in the case of Italy, structural reforms <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to be very important, in addition to the absolutely necessary frontloading of the structural measures. </p>
<p>This is the reason why we are strictly separating standard measures and non-standard measures, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> why we <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> as taking different measures from others. </p>
<p>That is our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>But one can see that not all central banks are in the same situation from this inflationary perspective and <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> standpoint. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that all countries must always be ahead of the curve. </p>
<p>It all <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the governments being ahead of the curve, full stop. </p>
<p>As regards the EFSF, it has been decided by the Heads of State and Government that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> intervene in the secondary markets on the basis of our ECB analysis, recognising the existence of exceptional financial market circumstances and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to financial stability. </p>
<p>It was <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more difficult to explain at a time when you did not see the confidence channel functioning. </p>
<p>That being said, it is clear that we have the letter of the governance that we have today, we have the spirit of the governance that we have today, and we have governance tomorrow and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the day after tomorrow. </p>
<p>I commented in advance it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>I do not want to go into too much detail because I spoke about that a year ago, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> recall. </p>
<p>They <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be politically difficult in our democracies. </p>
<p>That being said, the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that the decision that has been taken is implemented fully and rapidly, and it goes without saying that if it is implemented fully and rapidly, it would eliminate the reason why we, from time to time, intervene on the bond market through the non-standard measures that I already explained. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-09-08</b>, 36 sentences</p></div><p>In the euro area, the financing through banks amounts to <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 75%, with the markets making a much more modest contribution of <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 25%. </p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that we do not continue to call on all our financial institutions to be very attentive, in particular to retain earnings and take all <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> to strengthen their balance sheet position. </p>
<p>This idea that the banking sector would be short of euro liquidity is not what we are seeing and certainly is not what we are engineering, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>. </p>
<p>What has been observed <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to indicate that investors are viewing it as a serious orientation. </p>
<p>But the encouragement I can give is to say: be ahead of the curve and implement everything as rapidly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>In the United States the contribution of the markets is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> 75% and that of banks 25%. </p>
<p>More generally, though, we have always considered it, important that once a decision is taken -- and it can be a very solemn decision, taken by either a government or by a parliament, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the various institutional frameworks in place in each of our democracies -- then, there are a number of decisions to be executed, some of them very rapidly and on the basis of some kind of executive procedure, and in an effective and efficient manner. </p>
<p>We have full respect for the difficulty involved in taking the decisions, whether these decisions are taken by governments or by parliaments, as well as full respect for the challenges posed by these times and for the fact that our fellow citizens are the masters -- at the end of the day, as a fiercely independent institution, we <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the sentiment of 332 million fellow citizens, as does any independent entity in democracies. </p>
<p>The reasoning is as simple as that: I have nothing else to add at this stage and I have no information regarding any message which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be addressed to us. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> imagine, we reflected very thoroughly on the situation, on the multi-dimensional nature of the situation as regards the real economy, and as I have already said, the Governing Council changed its judgement and assessment on the qualification of the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We also looked very carefully at the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation, and again we changed our position, taking everything into account. </p>
<p>On top of that there is an enormous level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> ; this is the main message in this domain. </p>
<p>We have a very important role, and it is particularly important in times of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and of absence of confidence, because we have to act as a pillar of stability and confidence. </p>
<p>Our reasoning in this regard was very simple: do everything <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to improve your creditworthiness, meaning of the authorities and of the banking sector. </p>
<p>I would like very much to hear some congratulations for this institution, which has delivered price stability in Germany over <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 13 years at <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 1.55% - as the yearly average of inflation - we will <span class='uncertainty'>recalculate</span> the figure to the second decimal. </p>
<p>I can therefore understand that, seen from outside, from market places that have no experience of it, there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be fears, but they are unjustified. </p>
<p>It is a phenomenon which is very far-reaching and calls for us to be alert and act as soundly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in these circumstances. </p>
<p>On the general remark that fiscal soundness in difficult circumstances <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be counterproductive, I would say that it has to be analysed very carefully according to each particular situation. </p>
<p>As regards the governments and the executive branches, we expect, we are asking for, we make the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> -- which is the only reasonable working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> -- that all the decisions taken on 21 July will be fully comprehensively and rapidly implemented. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been the case in the past, but I do n't see it today. </p>
<p>My second observation is, as I said in the introductory remarks -- there is a paragraph on banks -- that we consider it to be absolutely essential that banks are as solid as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>However, the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> has, in our judgement, changed. </p>
<p>That ` s why we have never seen either a materialisation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of inflation or a threat of deflation in the eyes of the market. </p>
<p>As always, based on the staff projections, we qualify the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>There is clearly also <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> by way of consequence, as well as for other reasons, in the euro area. </p>
<p>I make the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the Greek government -- which has received a very strong message from the IMF, from the Commission in liaison with us, and from all the governments of Europe -- will do what is necessary, namely to fully, convincingly and immediately respect the commitment that has been made. </p>
<p>There is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> at the global level ; this is evident in the major global economies outside Europe. </p>
<p>This is based on a baseline scenario that has been <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downwards as regards growth. </p>
<p>As regards the ranges for this year and for next year, we are of the view that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are not balanced and that we have to take into account downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Second, as regards the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for both growth and inflation: if I compare the situation today with what we said a month ago, I would say that a month ago we considered the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth to be balanced, which is not the case today. </p>
<p>The significant change is that today we consider that there is a downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to growth. </p>
<p>As regards inflation, last month the sentiment was that there was an upside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to inflation, while today the judgement is that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation are balanced. </p>
<p>As I said, since the beginning of the crisis, we have n't seen any threat or materialisation of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation. </p>
<p>In my opinion, not just the euro area, but all advanced economies <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have real problems if they are not reasoning in the medium to long term. </p>
<p>Again, we always have to be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, prudent and to look at everything. </p>
<p>When I compare the order of magnitude of the theoretical overall potential eligible collateral, which is in the order of $ 13 trillion, and the liquidity that is provided, which is a little over $ 500 billion and oscillates between $ 530 billion and $ 550 billion, clearly it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to obtain liquidity which is a multiple of what we are supplying. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-10-06</b>, 34 sentences</p></div><p>That was eight years ago and four years before the start of the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> ! </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> refer again to what I said in my first hearing in Parliament eight years ago, which was to warn against any weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and to warn against any loose policies on the fiscal side. </p>
<p>These <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be listened to, but it is our strong duty to pass on what we see and what we think, given our responsibility and the angle from which we can view the situation. </p>
<p>But everything is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Ever since this period of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> began, the European Central Bank has always intervened immediately. </p>
<p>On your question about the present situation, let me first say that we should not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the euro as a currency with the issue of the difficulty of preserving financial stability in the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>With regard to the first question ; as always we had a long discussion on the pros and cons of all the decisions that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take. </p>
<p>From the very beginning, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that it was going to be a major global crisis with a lot of structural changes. </p>
<p>First, when the EFSF was decided on, we did indeed call on governments to leverage the EFSF as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in order to ensure financial stability. </p>
<p>I have already responded in terms of volume and, frankly speaking, I think that all the observations about the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> taken do not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> appropriate. </p>
<p>Depuis le début de la période de <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>, la Banque centrale européenne est intervenue de manière inédite. </p>
<p>Le 9 août 2007, nous avons pris pour la première fois la décision de donner de la liquidité à taux fixe et sans limites, et cette décision a marqué d'ailleurs le début de la crise, le début de la période de <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span>. </p>
<p>We have to be up to the new challenges that are largely <span class='uncertainty'>unpredictable</span>, let 's continue to be permanently alert," credible alertness '' is of the essence. '' </p>
<p>And not surprisingly, for the first time since World War II, the crisis is very much concentrated in the advanced economies -- the United States, Japan, Europe -- and we all have to try to adjust in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>So, one should avoid this <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> between the euro as a currency and the issue of financial stability in the euro area. </p>
<p>Second, I said very clearly that banks should reinforce their capital base, and we rely on the EBA and the decisions taken at the level of Europe as a whole to ensure that they do that in the best fashion <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>We are very proud to have issued the euro as a currency <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 13 years ago. </p>
<p>If it were not the case, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not work. </p>
<p>On your first question: as you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see, we have two categories of monetary policy instruments at our disposal. </p>
<p>And that is also something which calls upon us to do what we have judged appropriate to do and also to convey messages that are not easy to convey and, from time to time, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> a bit harsh to the destinatories. </p>
<p>So our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is very clear. </p>
<p>As for the third question, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give the floor to you, Jens. </p>
<p>This includes putting aside earnings, being moderate in the field of remuneration, turning to the private sector for a reinforcement of the balance sheets and recapitalisation, as well as, where necessary, going to the backstop of the governments, including the EFSF <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> which has been offered after the meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 21 July. </p>
<p>We will announce the exact technical details later on, but this is not to be <span class='uncertainty'>confused</span> with the SMP. </p>
<p>Second, the SMP is ongoing, and we do expect that the EFSF will be up and running as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, with the capacity to intervene on the secondary market, which is one of the very important decisions of 21 July. </p>
<p>These were new concepts, but they have now spread world over -- thanks also to the journalists at the press conference: and we are proud that this concept <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> to be state of the art. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the governments have all necessary capacity to leverage the EFSF themselves. </p>
<p>In response to your particular question, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the Introductory Statement gives you the pertinent information, namely the basis of the decision of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>It goes without saying that we apply <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management as attentively and <span class='uncertainty'>cautiously</span> as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>When you compute the potential losses or potential profits that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be registered by the various banks, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the various securities they have, you arrive at figures that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be very different. </p>
<p>On 9 August 2007 we took the decision, for the first time, to provide unlimited amounts of liquidity at a fixed rate, and this marked the beginning of the crisis, the beginning of the period of <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>. </p>
<p>We said -- and I have said this repeatedly on behalf of the members of the Governing Council -- that we faced the worst crisis since World War II, and that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been the worst since World War I. </p>
<p>And when you compute the full addition for the euro area as a whole, you get figures that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be very different, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on whether you do or do not take into account the cases where the credible securities have seen their value increase. </p>
<p>First of all, we have already said that our working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that what was signed by those 17 Heads of State or Government is implemented. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-11-03</b>, 15 sentences</p></div><p>But I will <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> protect myself by saying that it is too soon to tell ! </p>
<p>There is a strange" schizoid '' attitude because some people say that our balance sheet is at <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, while others say we should expand our balance sheet to help everybody. </p>
<p>In point of fact our balance sheet is not at <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and many things have been decided at the last European Council which made the Greek debt and the Greek counterparties compliant with our requirements. </p>
<p>As I said before, we looked at the behaviour of several <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> -- the real economy, where we observe the weakening of various aggregate demand components ; we looked at survey data, showing a worsening of the indicators that I mentioned before ; we looked at other forecasts by other organisations, and they also showed a weakening of this -- and then we looked at our monetary analysis. </p>
<p>But the way to react to this is not to count on external help that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> alleviate the temporary market pressures, instead the real answer is actually to count on the countries ' capacity to reform themselves with the right economic policies -- and I listed them before, in response to a previous question. </p>
<p>As we had what the economists call" undershooting '' for a long period of time, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> now have" overshooting ''. </p>
<p>We cross-checked the two and we concluded that there was basically a weakening of the business cycle and also the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> downwards our projections that will be presented next month. </p>
<p>That increased <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion among all investors worldwide and made their analysis more perceptive of the different <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in different countries. </p>
<p>So, one has no reason to <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> the commitment of the government. </p>
<p>Right now, the Chinese economy, even though it is mildly slowing, is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> one of the few sources of growth in the global economy. </p>
<p>As for the future, let me do my work and we will have periodic checks as to whether I am in sync with this tradition or <span class='uncertainty'>deviating</span> from it. </p>
<p>Let me remind you that, last month, President Trichet said that the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of a rate cut was discussed in the meeting, so the decisions today are not something that are out of line with the continuity of analysis and, as the President explained, the indicators since then have only aggravated and justified today 's decisions. </p>
<p>So we should keep this in mind because this in a sense answers all the questions that one <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have. </p>
<p>It is really pointless to think that sovereign bond rates <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be stably brought down for a protracted period of time by external interventions. </p>
<p>I do not know whether" legalistic '' kind of belittles this concept -- it is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> not the right word -- but what it is meant to say is that we are using the Treaty as our reference point for decisions in areas as important as this one and, in that sense, it is the right word to use. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2011-12-08</b>, 14 sentences</p></div><p>Because, in spite of everything that <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> quite far-fetched at this point in time. </p>
<p>But there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be technical aspects that <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> do not ensure the complete sterilisation immediately. </p>
<p>On the second one, the rate cuts are meant to address a situation where you have weaker global growth, different conditions -- worse conditions overall -- and heightened <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>It is thoroughly imprudent to create <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> plans where we see no <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of such events happening. </p>
<p>I always find it <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> puzzling that this is actually where most of the attention is focused when we know that the lack of credibility or the lack of confidence stems from the other two, from the lack of the other two pillars originally. </p>
<p>My preference in respect of this stability mechanism -- but this is my preference -- is for the EFSF, the EFSF first, and the ESM later, to be fully equipped and operational, and made operational as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>One <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have some amounts that are not sterilised immediately. </p>
<p>I do not think it is useful to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about break ups or such things. </p>
<p>At the present time we do not see a high <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of deflation. </p>
<p>I am old enough to remember that, when this Treaty was written in the early 1990s, some of the countries around that table were actually doing what you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> doing now, namely some of the central banks of these countries were financing the government expenditure of their governments through money creation, and the consequences were there for all of us to see. </p>
<p>However, we know that in the present situation this confidence-enhancing effect <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on at least two factors: first it requires that national economic policies be geared towards fiscal stability ; and, second, it is linked to the progress made on designing the new European fiscal rules, fiscal set-up or fiscal compact. </p>
<p>A compact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be viewed as a three-pillar-concept: The first pillar is national economic policies geared to stability, growth and job creation -- fiscal stability, growth and competitiveness, and therefore job creation. </p>
<p>One of my collaborators said that compact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be read as" community pact '', but that was not meant to be my initial suggestion. </p>
<p>The issue of whether the IMF <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used as a channel is legally very complex. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-01-12</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>However, I would say that there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some of the stressed countries are actually making very significant progress in terms of fiscal consolidation. </p>
<p>And on top of this, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have foreign investors as well, which certainly do not borrow from the ECB, but can bid at the auctions. </p>
<p>That it is in the sense the" green light '': a" green light '' to undertake the necessary structural reforms that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> enhance competitiveness, job creation and growth. </p>
<p>By the way, it would be highly welcome if this fiscal compact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be signed by the end of this month rather than waiting until March. </p>
<p>There are countries that, all in all, <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be living through the crisis with lower growth rates, but are experiencing no sizeable developments that you would call a recession. </p>
<p>Let me read to you this:" The members of the Governing Council shall not use confidential information to which they have access for the purpose of carrying out private financial transactions, whether directly or indirectly via third parties, or whether conducted at their own <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and for their own account or at the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and for the account of a third party. '' </p>
<p>I said in my Introductory Statement that we are seeing a weakening in euro area economic activity, as well as significant downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and a very high level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>On your third question on interest rates, we never pre-commit in such situations of high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>As for the second question, I do not really comment on Mr Bini Smaghi 's views and I really do not know what a tailor-made quantitative easing for the euro area <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be. </p>
<p>I am confident that there is no <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> at all that the same exercise is going to be repeated in the future. </p>
<p>Some survey data <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be some stabilisation at low levels. </p>
<p>For example, the bidding behaviour in the access to the LTRO is also <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the amount of bonds coming due for that specific institution in the first quarter of this year. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> the conditions that I mentioned before. </p>
<p>On the first question: there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that by expanding the collateral eligibility rules, as we have done to increase access to the 3-year LTRO to a much larger variety of banks, we are also expanding the potential <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we are taking onto our balance sheet. </p>
<p>So this decision certainly prevented a potentially major funding constraint for our banking system, with all the negative consequences this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have had on the credit side. </p>
<p>But our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management is actually very, very careful and we have a very well developed system of haircuts, of risk-pricing and another <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> reduction rules. </p>
<p>And the third is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion. </p>
<p>So, even though I think we are making a substantial contribution to the real economy in accepting this new collateral, we are also quite confident that we will manage the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> entailed. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I ask the Vice-President if you want to add something on the ECB 's stance on Greece? </p>
<p>And the third is that <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is very high and we will monitor all the developments and will stand ready to act. </p>
<p>Excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. </p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that the decision provided all banks in the euro area with an insurance against the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of being without liquidity. </p>
<p>I think there are usually, by and large, three reasons why banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not lend. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-02-09</b>, 38 sentences</p></div><p>Sure, it is going to be more <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span>. </p>
<p>And the third part of the reason relates to <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion. </p>
<p>I said that we have to wait and see, because partly it relates to the funding pressures that banks <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> for the first quarter of this year and that we have removed with our three-year LTRO. </p>
<p>To some extent, they also address <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion -- to the extent that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion results from a perceived lack of liquidity on the part of a counterparty. </p>
<p>Yes, it means that we take more <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>Let me add one thing, because <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I am not being completely clear. </p>
<p>Of this three, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> must be assessed according to the common guideline and presented to the Governing Council. </p>
<p>Does it mean that we take more <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>? </p>
<p>So, with a credit claim of about 9, strong over-collateralisation would yield around four -- or three, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> -- as acceptable collateral. </p>
<p>Concerning the collateral, on top of all the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management measures and on top of all the strong over-collateralisation -- which, once you apply these haircuts, reduces the amount of acceptable collateral by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> two-thirds -- to assess the creditworthiness of a credit claim it is essential to know the economy where this credit claim originated. </p>
<p>But I can not say what we can do about this until tonight, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> after the Eurogroup meeting. </p>
<p>As I have constantly said, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is high -- <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> relating to the global economy, to sovereign tensions, to the credit markets and to global growth. </p>
<p>In a sense, it is a further mitigating measure for the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> we are <span class='uncertainty'>assuming</span>. </p>
<p>The idea that the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually give money to the programme would violate the prohibition of monetary financing. </p>
<p>But that is not necessarily a negative thing in itself, because when banks set their pricing for their credits they look at what their other investment opportunities are, to the extent that they <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> invest in government bonds. </p>
<p>Does it mean this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has not been managed? </p>
<p>Therefore, we want to keep the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> related to these assessments with national central banks so they bear the full <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of their choices. </p>
<p>The fourth quarter of 2011 was very weak, but we have seen a stream of both survey and hard data that <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to point to a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level. </p>
<p>But, as I have said repeatedly, these operations address the liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, not the lack of capital. </p>
<p>The important thing is that once we take these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, firstly we do n't judge them to be excessive and secondly, and most importantly, we manage them well. </p>
<p>So if we have taken more <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, we have also made sure that this is going to be very well managed, and the purpose, as I said, is to finance the real economy and especially SMEs, which account for <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 80% of employment. </p>
<p>Yes, it does <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span>. </p>
<p>We have full confidence in our staff that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> can be well managed. </p>
<p>We take <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> with everything: we take <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> with normal monetary policy operations, with LTROs, with the SMP. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a gap, but I frankly do n't know how much that is and we will know more in the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>As you noticed, everybody has been talking about what the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not do, what would be nice for the ECB to do and so on, but the ECB did not say anything. </p>
<p>We will look -- obviously together with the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management officers and other very competent staff, -- at the assessments, we will have a discussion and if the Governing Council is not satisfied it will not be accepted. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have heard what Jens Weidmann said recently about the IMF forecast for Germany. </p>
<p>Regarding the level of the second LTRO the specialists in this field say that it should be substantial and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> around the level of the previous one. </p>
<p>The big question that I saw in at least one press article was: ` but this is going to be very <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span>, is n't it '? </p>
<p>As we all know, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is high at the present time, and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for growth still persist. </p>
<p>But admittedly, it is a very short time to judge someone, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> get much worse. </p>
<p>But this does not imply any more <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the so-called ` creditor countries '. </p>
<p>I would not say markedly, but it does <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> in the sense that we are less pessimistic than the IMF. </p>
<p>Once we had provided the first three-year LTRO, we also asked ourselves how we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make sure that this facility would reach not only the large banks, which usually have plenty of collateral and packaged in a way that corresponds to our eligibility criteria, but also the small and medium-sized banks that are most important for financing small and medium-sized enterprises -LRB- SMEs -RRB-. </p>
<p>The interest rate changes address pricing conditions, <span class='uncertainty'>assuming</span> that the euro area banking and financial conditions are working well, that the circumstances are normal. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>, if you make a loss on the sales that is monetary financing. </p>
<p>We, the Governing Council, thought that the amount of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that was taken on board was perfectly acceptable and very well managed. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-03-08</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>So this criticism does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be grounded, at least as far as we are concerned. </p>
<p>On your last question, let me say that I am really confident that the referendum will pass and that the fiscal compact will be approved, because Ireland is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> one of the programme countries that has made most progress, under conditions that have been very harsh. </p>
<p>You recently wrote a piece on the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are in the ECB 's balance sheet because of the LTRO. </p>
<p>We have always <span class='uncertainty'>assumed</span> that structural reforms have an impact on growth in the long term, but that is not always true for all reforms. </p>
<p>But there are reasons for that: foreign demand, the very low level of short and medium-term interest rates, and the extraordinary improvement in the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> environment, which if it is maintained, is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> going to be the main factor that we can count on. </p>
<p>The comparison of the overall amount does not really relate to the issue of whether <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have increased or not. </p>
<p>We have this in mind because 80% of euro area employment <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the SMEs. </p>
<p>Comparisons by country are actually appropriate up to a point, I am not talking about the 430 small German banks -- incidentally I would love to review the places, the towns and villages where these banks are, but I can not do it because often they would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be the only bank in town and so they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be recognised. </p>
<p>We address the aspects that relate to liquidity and funding, and we can not and do not want at all to replace either the fiscal actions of the governments or to address a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> lack of capital held by the banks. </p>
<p>So when people say that the LTRO <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make the banking system more <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on the ECB, they forget that there were no interbank markets before, because they were completely clogged up. </p>
<p>But we can also see downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to staff inflation projection coming from an environment which remains weak, from a labour market which, as you can see, remains slack with unemployment actually going up. </p>
<p>In answer to your question, when I said that we see some upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation developments, I mean that the oil price <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> end up being higher than expected and this is linked to these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>The other thing that is related to the letter -- and, incidentally, I do n't think that the leak came from Jens himself, I am certain that it was not him -- is that the substance, the content of that letter is present in all our minds: the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of our monetary policy, the complications -- which are largely communication-related, I would say -- created by the use of additional credit claims, and the TARGET2 balances as well. </p>
<p>You have to make the comparison in terms of the additional <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> caused by the two LTROs. </p>
<p>The reason this argument is raised is the fear that the exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually be affected by these monetary policies. </p>
<p>Therefore, at the present time, to say that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the ECB 's balance sheet are higher than those for Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England is not correct. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management of the ECB is actually quite careful and should be given credit for this I think. </p>
<p>The ECB staff knows how to manage <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but this is not something we foresee. </p>
<p>So it is not correct to say that the collateral rules <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be looser. </p>
<p>This tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> was not necessarily a credit event in a specific country. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that the two LTROs have removed the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that was present. </p>
<p>On the Spanish Government in particular, the European Commission has said that they have to have all the figures in place, because <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> there is a certain dialogue about ratios and figures and deficits-to-GDP ratios to be achieved by the end of 2012 and 2013. </p>
<p>They <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be happy with what is going on -- and they certainly know more about what is going on than I do. </p>
<p>It was an environment of heightened <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> environment has improved enormously, markets have reopened, both senior and secure markets, covered bond markets, and even the interbank market -- although still limited to the short term and to national boundaries -- has also started working a little better. </p>
<p>But basically, the LTRO had the powerful effect of removing what is called" tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> '' from the environment. </p>
<p>Just to give you an idea: the haircuts on these additional credit claims are very high -- and they are meant to be very high -- so as to make the <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span> of these additional credit claims about the same as the <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span> of the rest of the collateral, for which the haircuts are lower. </p>
<p>And of this, I would say, <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> 40 billion euros was pledged by French banks that were basically already over-collateralised. </p>
<p>So, these <span class='uncertainty'>tended</span> to be periods of very strong growth. </p>
<p>They simply increased their collateral for the future as a <span class='uncertainty'>precaution</span>. </p>
<p>When you look at that, we see upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, coming from the higher than expected oil prices, from indirect taxation that has been widely used by governments in their fiscal consolidation efforts and from administered prices. </p>
<p>And, there, two things <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> happen: the deposit facility goes up, which is what you would expect in the shortest run, and then gradually the required reserves deposited with the ECB go up, if you have a credit expansion by the banks in the euro area. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-04-04</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>In a sense, they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> benefit from this relative quietness -- quietness <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a too strong word -- relative peace of financial markets, but it is also a window of opportunity for banks to repair their balance sheets, to deleverage what they ought to deleverage in an orderly fashion. </p>
<p>Or they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be structural. </p>
<p>So, after all this had taken place, it was only natural to say then that each NCB is free to accept or reject these bonds, because, after all, the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> would fall only upon the specific NCB. </p>
<p>So it is completely and materially irrelevant, and unfortunately, there was major <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> in communications. </p>
<p>Some banks that have had a big impact as a result of the PSI, because they had a lot of Greek bonds and so on, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to be restructured, meaning merging with others, resolved and so on. </p>
<p>And these heterogeneities -- these differences -- <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be differences in inflation, growth, employment, competitiveness and productivity. </p>
<p>Then we decided that we would not share the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> arising from this type of bond but that each NCB should bear the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of accepting these bonds. </p>
<p>What this sentence basically says is that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be heterogeneities -- and that 's particularly true at times like this. </p>
<p>So, in a sense it was our duty to protect taxpayers ' money in any way <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>The second is that we <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that they ought to be protected to ensure the integrity of the ECB 's balance sheet, and therefore its independence. </p>
<p>The whole plan will be implemented in an orderly fashion without creating any <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in Greece as a result of this process. </p>
<p>And they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be temporary, like those we have seen in the United States, for example. </p>
<p>And as this plan is being applied, some of them <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, for a temporary period, lose access to normal monetary operations. </p>
<p>But there will be no <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> and no surprises with the implementation of this plan. </p>
<p>But the fourth reason, and it 's really <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the most important reason, is demand. </p>
<p>What is important to underline is that there is a huge amount of money in the second programme approved for Greece to deal with the recapitalisation of Greek banks and also all the operations to restructure the sector, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> involve loss absorption. </p>
<p>The third is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, and to the extent that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the perception that the counterparty does n't have funding, we have taken care of that. </p>
<p>But if the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion perception is one where you have the sense that your counterparty does n't have capital, we can not take care of that. </p>
<p>So, it is, by necessity, only a partial analysis that is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> today. </p>
<p>As for the second question, the two LTROs were conceived and designed to make sure that also small banks, which are also the closest to the SMEs, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have access to that so that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take this money closer to the SMEs. </p>
<p>As Ireland strives to regain market confidence -- and frankly I have very few <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> that it will succeed -- it is of the utmost importance that the commitments of the Irish State are met in line with standing contracts and agreements. </p>
<p>I think that, given the current conditions for the situation of, and especially the outlook for, prices, there <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be -- as I have said -- no inflationary pressures and inflation expectations are firmly anchored over the medium term. </p>
<p>Every day actually, not <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> every day ! </p>
<p>These are three things that we look at <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> every day. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in the values of inclusion and solidarity, but the present rules do n't allow, do n't make this social model -- it 's not European, by the way, but a social model that prevails in some countries in Europe, not everywhere -- these rules make it unsustainable. </p>
<p>Now, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> it happens that they give this collateral to NCBs of other countries. </p>
<p>So we are really talking about a very narrowly restricted set, and it <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> only natural, since NCBs were taking all the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, to grant NCBs freedom to decide whether they wanted to take it or not. </p>
<p>And if they are temporary, they will <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to compensate for each other. </p>
<p>The intent of the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> managers is to make these claims equivalent in terms of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to the traditional claims. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-05-03</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>But the answer we can give as policy-makers is to make sure that the policies that are implemented or <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> are the policies we are convinced are going to be the right ones. </p>
<p>These are jobs that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be sustained. </p>
<p>And this is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the best way to address your question -- be clear, be sincere, be straight with yourself and with others. </p>
<p>Its functioning fell short of both expectations and needs because it was created in a way that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> hardly be made to work. </p>
<p>I think we saw stabilising economic activity at low levels in the first three months and then the most recent survey data show <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> prevailing. </p>
<p>But as I said, we have absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the action will be taken and will be as speedy and transparent as the other European countries and as the markets themselves require it to be. </p>
<p>At euro area level, these averages <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to offset each other to some extent, albeit not completely. </p>
<p>There are countries that are not in a recession, and which are actually <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> at full employment, and there are countries that are in a recession. </p>
<p>Finally, there continues to be a significant drop in some of the key indicators of the financial market <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> such as some of the key spreads, and a significant drop in the repo rates and others. </p>
<p>It is not really technical ; it is mostly political and is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most important. </p>
<p>So, for the time being, we look at all these events on an <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> daily basis, and we find things that we did not find the last time. </p>
<p>Upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> pertain to higher than expected commodity prices and indirect tax increases, while downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relate to weaker than expected developments in economic activity. '' </p>
<p>There are lots of measures that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> stimulate job creation in the private sector, and there are a certain number of measures at European level that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> address the infrastructure spending issue. </p>
<p>What happens in between, in a sense, <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the main actors involved in this process. </p>
<p>I was hinting at the 1980s as a time from which we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> learn some lessons, but the 1970s were years of very high deficits and we basically all found ourselves, more or less to the same extent, in a situation of high inflation and recession. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember, the SMP was created to address malfunctioning or non-functioning in the channels of transmission of monetary policy. </p>
<p>So the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced. </p>
<p>Yes, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> like that, and that 's exactly right. </p>
<p>It is very important what I said at the beginning of page 3 of my introductory statement:"... <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for HICP inflation rates in the coming years are still seen to be broadly balanced. </p>
<p>I said there are upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Let me make two <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> observations in this respect. </p>
<p>No, we did not discuss any specific move on interest rates but we certainly discussed our general monetary policy stance, which we found accommodative in view of an economic outlook that is becoming more <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>Also, nobody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> deny that liquidity is abundant in the euro area. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-06-06</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually be closer than we all expected until, I would say months ago. </p>
<p>I think one response is that some things concerning this financial market union <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually be achieved in a relatively rapid way. </p>
<p>Other parts of this concept of financial market union, -- like everything that really entails mutualisation -- is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> more medium-term or long-term. </p>
<p>So, I do n't think we should take this line of reasoning too far, i.e. to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that all the problems of a country with a high and rising deficit, with high levels of public debt and so on, that all of these problems <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on Europe. </p>
<p>Having said that, work is now in progress: as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> all understand, it is potentially very important work and we will certainly contribute with all our skills and expertise to this work. </p>
<p>You have seen spreads going down for Ireland much more than for <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> any other country. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> were not born yet, but, unfortunately I remember that and Vítor does too. </p>
<p>You remember that originally we said that by the end of this year we go below 2%, then we said it is going to go below 2% in the next year -- now we have the first hints that this shifting <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> actually stop. </p>
<p>In the next European Council we all expect a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> of this vision. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> in some cases it is too early to see the benefits, but I also think that the full benefits <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be achieved if we were to clarify what the euro is going to be in five or ten years ' time -- this is where I think the efforts of the leaders are oriented. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> we use the word too much, but when we say" vision '' we basically have in mind the path towards an objective with all the conditions that have to be satisfied in order to achieve this objective. </p>
<p>From one perspective, the answer is yes, because the ESM <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> recapitalise banks without the debt of the country increasing. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see credit flows going down well before the end of the year. </p>
<p>It was the" worst is over, but there are serious downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> ''. </p>
<p>Immediately <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> spreads widened, <span class='uncertainty'>varying</span> the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in different countries according to their inflation rates, the state of their deficits, the state of the level of their debt, and so on. </p>
<p>We have already conducted two LTROs, which have prevented more serious credit crunches and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> more serious disruptions to the financial and banking sectors. </p>
<p>Our primary mandate is price stability and we think that if we achieve this objective in the medium term with all our necessary instruments we really contribute in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> way to growth. </p>
<p>That is why I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the very fact of having an objective, a goal, an end point and a clear path would, by itself, contribute to a stabilisation of the financial situation in Europe. </p>
<p>This is the first point - The second is that to some extent we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> weakening of the economy of the euro area <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be due to a credit contraction that actually started last year. </p>
<p>In this sense, credit flows <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have stabilised. </p>
<p>The" serious downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> '' were taken off the sentence, and I was represented as having only said the first part. </p>
<p>We are rightly alarmed that there has been stress in the markets, and some of the indices that <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to point to the stabilisation of financial markets until, say, three weeks ago, are now increasing again. </p>
<p>So Europe <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have some responsibility, but these countries have their own responsibilities, their own policy problems which have still not been addressed and are still unresolved. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> that Europe is the source of problems that Brazil or China <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have -- and I think that there is <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> a grain of truth in that -- but I would not say that the reason why the global economy <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> weaken in the near future is because of Europe only. </p>
<p>The fact is that when I made the statement, it <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> that all the signals of tensions in the financial markets after the incredible situation in November and December were about to fade away rapidly, which they did, and now they are worsening again. </p>
<p>I think that all of us -- and this is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> going to be the main message of the upcoming G20 summit, which is going to take place in a few days in Los Cabos in Mexico -- all countries and all areas have to work together. </p>
<p>At the same time, we have to acknowledge that this baseline scenario is based on <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, such as an abatement of financial tensions in the future and, overall an ongoing buoyancy in external demand. </p>
<p>We are fully aware that the most recent soft data point to the downside, which is why you will find several references to downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the Introductory Statement. </p>
<p>I think that 's the main difference between now and then, so I do n't think the situation is <span class='uncertainty'>nearly</span> as bad as it was. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to go back to July/August when this credit contraction started, because, ahead of them, in the first quarter of this year, banks had a very serious funding situation. </p>
<p>In other words, the transmission that takes place through financial channels is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> stronger than the transmission that we see through the traditional multiplier effects. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-07-05</b>, 39 sentences</p></div><p>And that has a lot to do with the weakening of the general economy, but also with the behaviour of oil prices, as we have to bear in mind, of course, that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go either way. </p>
<p>And fairly <span class='uncertainty'>unusually</span> for me, I will also tell you why we did not discuss that -- because we have to have non-standard measures which are effective, and they have to be effective in an area which is fragmented. </p>
<p>We still have all our artillery ready to contain inflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in order to pursue the objective of price stability. </p>
<p>And, frankly, on the other part of your question and your colleague 's question, I would say that, at this point in time, we are not really elaborating on various non-standard situations in which we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> find ourselves. </p>
<p>But the rest of the economy does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be inclined to generate upward pressure on inflation. </p>
<p>But let us not forget that they are also paying less on the LTRO <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span>: so, they get less on the deposit, but they pay less on the other side. </p>
<p>On the question of bubbles, one of the reasons for taking the decision that we have taken today is that we do not really see any <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation expectations, on either side, certainly not on the upside in the short or medium term. </p>
<p>As regards the LIBOR, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> there is an enquiry taking place at this very moment. </p>
<p>But certainly all the conditions <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be there for compliance with the programme which is, of course, a very important objective. </p>
<p>And so, in a sense, the baseline scenario of the ECB has not changed, although the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to that baseline scenario are now materialising. </p>
<p>These are the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> on which our expectation of this slow, gradual recovery by the turn of the year is predicated. </p>
<p>There were some <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> highlighted but the conclusion was positive. </p>
<p>Even though, as I have said, market sentiment <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be improving slightly. </p>
<p>Of course, the collateral they give should be acceptable and should not increase the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of the balance sheets of the ECB. </p>
<p>Of course, if the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium is high, then this will be less effective. </p>
<p>And unfortunately the answer is that this very much <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on demand for credit. </p>
<p>How this is going to affect their business decisions or their convenience decisions is very hard to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span>. </p>
<p>The answer is basically that we should not forget that nominal rates are very, very low ; real rates are negative and certainly the expectation of a recovery by the turn of the year -- although muted, although slow, although very gradual and so on -- is based on an improvement in the general sentiment, an abating in the sovereign debt crisis and in a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> improving market sentiment on the financial markets. </p>
<p>We should not forget, and some of the statements <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to forget, that everything -- the ESM recapitalisation, the stepping-in of the EFSF or the ESM in the primary or secondary markets -- is subject to conditionality. </p>
<p>This is much earlier than anybody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have expected until two or three months ago. </p>
<p>On the second point, it is difficult to foresee how banks <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> behave. </p>
<p>And we want to do this to keep the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the ECB balance sheet -- and I have said this many times -- very, very low. </p>
<p>On the first question, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> ask this question every time we change interest rates: what is the situation? </p>
<p>Second, whatever the proposal <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be, it should be such that the ECB can carry out any tasks assigned to it in an effective, rigorous and independent way, without <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to its reputation. </p>
<p>And frankly, I think that, right now, the ESM and the EFSF with the new modalities are big enough to cope with the <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> that we can envisage now. </p>
<p>Even though this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not yet be part of a regular extended programme for a long period of time, I think that this success should be properly celebrated, and it is a testament to the determination of the Irish government and the capacity of the Irish people to understand and" own '' this programme and make the needed sacrifices. </p>
<p>Banks <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have an incentive to return what they had in the deposit facility earlier if they were sure that, for most scenarios, they would not need that liquidity any time soon. </p>
<p>You have <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span>, but that is what we have done so far. </p>
<p>We now see that the objective of having an inflation rate for the whole euro area that is close to but below 2% will be met in 2013, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> even before then, but do not ask me the exact date, day and time when this will happen. </p>
<p>One is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, another is a lack of capital, and the third is a lack of funding. </p>
<p>What we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do and what we have done with respect to this is broaden the eligibility rules of collateral so as to attract the greatest number of banks, including those banks of a small/medium size which we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> are closest to the SMEs. </p>
<p>But there is a fourth reason, and that is that when we were discussing it a month ago, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not say that we had the same picture for the whole of the euro area as we do today. </p>
<p>Deflation is a protracted and generalised drop in the price level, so protracted and so strong and so generalised that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> disanchor inflationary expectations. </p>
<p>On the first question, generally speaking, the idea that the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> channel funds via the bank lending channel to a specific category of firms or households is as wrong as the idea that the ECB should make sure banks do n't buy government bonds as otherwise it is monetary financing. </p>
<p>`` Wrong '' is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> too strong, but certainly both ideas are very, very hard to implement, requiring us to make sure that the banks do certain things or do n't do certain things. </p>
<p>What we said is basically that downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are materialising for the economic outlook, and that this would dampen price behaviour in the short and medium term. </p>
<p>Several observations: one is that, as I have said many times, there are at least three sets of reasons why banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not lend. </p>
<p>I am sure that this will be done as speedily as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Actually, it is so important that an event like this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be one of the factors that are making the financial environment nowadays a little less tense than it was a month ago. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-08-02</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>Oh, does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be very impressed... </p>
<p>And today we had a meeting, we discussed, and we have given guidance which will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> concretise certain decisions that will be taken. </p>
<p>Let me say that this concept, the guidance that we have given to the committees of the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>differs</span> from the previous programme, because that is basically what your first question is about. </p>
<p>The upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relate to food prices, which do not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> today for euro area inflation for the reason that, first of all, the increases have so far been viewed as one-off shocks. </p>
<p>At that point, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> act, if needed, along the lines that I have illustrated today. </p>
<p>Second, much of the food that is consumed in the euro area is produced by the euro area and therefore food prices <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on agricultural prices. </p>
<p>But there are some <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> both on the upside and the downside. </p>
<p>So the Governing Council, under the necessary and sufficient conditions and within the context of its total independence of monetary policy operations, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decide to do certain things if these conditions are satisfied. </p>
<p>Energy prices and the depreciation of the euro have advanced, but we do not really see any change in what has become our baseline scenario, namely of inflation standing at around 2% by the end of this year and <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> going below 2% next year or even before next year. </p>
<p>In the context of LTROs, maturities <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> extend to three years, of course, but in normal operations maturities like the ones we are operating on right now can go from six months to nine months to a year. </p>
<p>It has not been thought about and it is not being discussed, not only because we are proud of our own independence, but also because they <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not even want to know. </p>
<p>On the negative deposit rates -- since many of you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be asking this question -- I will say only that for us these are largely unchartered waters. </p>
<p>Regarding sterilisation, you should not <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that we are not going to sterilise or that we will sterilise -- you have to understand, these operations are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>With regard to your question on bond purchases, I do not know where that rumour <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have arisen from. </p>
<p>`` The Governing Council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy '' -- which means that to go to the EFSF is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one, because the monetary policy is independent --" <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective. </p>
<p>The first point is very important because we want to repair monetary policy transmission channels and we clearly see a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, and I mean the convertibility premium in some interest rates. </p>
<p>The biggest advance that we made in the early 1990s was basically to tell banks that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do both, so the issue was not even considered at that time. </p>
<p>The decision we took was to earmark these profits for distribution to the national central banks with a view to further redistributing them to their national governments, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> use them for Greece. </p>
<p>We have discussed <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> reductions in interest rates, but the Governing Council in its entirety decided that this was not the time, and that 's it. </p>
<p>I would not point to one single episode but certainly one thing, if one really wants to, was the <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> increase in the shorter part of the yield curve for several countries in the euro area, which for people who know the markets is usually ominous. </p>
<p>There is no reason to be specific as far as further non-standard measures are concerned because the other part of the guidance is that the relevant committees should examine the other <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> measures. </p>
<p>It says" <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undertake ''. </p>
<p>So it is not really a reaction to a specific thing that as you said <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have terrified us because we usually do not act on terror but on normal, cool analysis of facts. </p>
<p>The only separation we had was between banks that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> only do short term and banks that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> only do long term. </p>
<p>It says:" the Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undertake outright open market operations of a size.... </p>
<p>The Governing Council, within its mandate to maintain price stability over the medium term and in observance of its independence in determining monetary policy, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective '', and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>It says:"... <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective. </p>
<p>There is a list of various options, which you can actually find in our previous press conferences or in the ECB bulletin ; that will be studied, explored, reviewed and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> utilised if needed for a formal decision. </p>
<p>And I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go on with other signs of monetary fragmentation as far as bank funding is concerned, as far as sovereign bond markets are concerned, and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Rather than respond to you on how we measure this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium, which is also a task of our committees, let me tell you that our greatest concern is financial market fragmentation rather than assessing exactly a figure. </p>
<p>That was one sign but I would not point only to that symptom, since there were other symptoms of market fragmentation which <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to worsen the situation. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-09-06</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>We see this from a variety of indicators: not only the level of yields, the yield spreads, but also <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and especially liquidity conditions in many parts of the euro area. </p>
<p>They do not reflect only unfounded fears of <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> reversibility, they also reflect the quality of the outstanding credit of these countries. </p>
<p>And incidentally, outright purchases of bonds are identified, in Article 18 of the Statute of the ECB, as one of the various <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> tools that our monetary policy has and can use. </p>
<p>It is the Governing Council that, in its <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> unanimous decision, has taken this measure. </p>
<p>It shows that it is not only the decision of former lira members or others, it is basically the <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> unanimous decision of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>On the second question -- the first question I have already answered -- certainly, there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be such an incentive. </p>
<p>We will monitor the situation very carefully, but, at the same time, one <span class='uncertainty'>assumes</span> that countries would like to keep a structure of debt issuance which is balanced across all maturities. </p>
<p>So there is a danger, there is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but it is not at all clear that debt issuers will actually move in this direction because it has a cost, namely of unbalancing a maturity structure which was <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> balanced to begin with and has taken many years to achieve. </p>
<p>At the same time, we see that we are in a bad equilibrium and, therefore, policy action, though convincing, does not <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to produce -- at least not in the relatively medium term -- the results for which it is geared. </p>
<p>As I have said, this is a fully effective backstop removing tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for Europe, and I would not want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on other measures for the time being at least. </p>
<p>I think that, in my job as president, I have been blessed by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> having unanimity on the very important and fundamental decisions that we have taken in the last few months. </p>
<p>As far as Portugal and Ireland are concerned, the press statement says that Outright Monetary Transactions" <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be also considered for Member States currently under macroeconomic adjustment programme when they will be regaining bond market access ''. </p>
<p>That is one of the differences, and I think it is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most important. </p>
<p>We are trying to do something which we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> is very important for the euro area and for price stability, which is to repair monetary policy transmission channels in the euro area. </p>
<p>It was basically the common view that in addition to the <span class='uncertainty'>precautionary</span> programme you also have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of a full macroeconomic adjustment programme, and I would consider that the two forms have broad conditionality and require involvement of all the other euro area governments. </p>
<p>When we last decided to reduce rates, we had <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span> this weakening in the business cycle. </p>
<p>First, in terms of the size, I said there is no ex ante quantitative limit to these interventions because we want this to be perceived as a fully effective backstop that removes tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> from the euro area. </p>
<p>And it is three years because it <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to us the maximum most effective maturity to target: it is close to our short-term policy rates ; it affects also the medium-term yield curve ; it is close to the rates that are being used to lend to the private sector ; it is, in a certain sense, similar to the maturity we used for the LTROs ; and also, in a very indirect way, it decreases concerns about our seniority over the bond holdings. </p>
<p>On" conditionality '', the assessment of the Governing Council is that we are in a situation now where you have large parts of the euro area in what we call a" bad equilibrium '', namely an equilibrium where you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have self-fulfilling expectations that feed upon themselves and generate very adverse scenarios. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Volatility</span> is also very important, in terms of the indicators that we plan to take into consideration in planning our interventions. </p>
<p>What we have put in place today is an effective backstop to remove tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> from the euro area, and the ECB will retain its independence throughout. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-10-04</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>With regard to whether the level of interest rates reflects redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, as I said before, we are considering a variety of indicators here, one of which is the interest rates and then we are also considering those I mentioned, namely the bid-ask spreads, liquidity, the shape of the yield curves and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>By the way, I think, and that is my purely personal perception, that all of the countries that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> need an OMT have now reached, after many years of a difficult, very difficult process, reasonable maturities, reasonable durations in their stock of public debt. </p>
<p>The OMT would not apply to countries that are under a full adjustment programme until -- and that is what I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> I said last time -- until full market access, complete market access has been obtained. </p>
<p>We do not <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on future changes in interest rates. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that with the adoption of the stabilisation measures that I mentioned before, spreads will go down and I understand -- no I do not only understand, you can verify yourself -- that spreads have gone down. </p>
<p>On the first question, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that today we are ready with our OMTs. </p>
<p>When the OMT was designed, we had the perception and the evidence that there were tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the euro area, namely that there was a bad equilibrium for certain countries in certain markets. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the Commission 's proposal does foresee the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of the Governing Council delegating all the supervisory tasks to the Supervisory Board. </p>
<p>In any event the ECB will closely monitor this <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> strategic response by issuers. </p>
<p>As I have said over and over again, I think that through the OMT programme, the ECB has done everything <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly create an environment which is conducive to reforms because it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> remove what we call the redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>With the adoption of further measures I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that spreads will go down as they have done in other euro area countries. </p>
<p>First of all, <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is still relatively high and, secondly, governments will have to persevere in their reform action on all fronts: fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, the banking sector and more generally the financial market sector. </p>
<p>When you see that the bid-ask spreads reveal a profound lack of liquidity in certain markets, when you see that levels of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> are abnormally high and when you see that you have the inversion of the yield curves all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span>, which then disappears right after an announcement, then you say that you have a reasonable and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> unacceptable level of fragmentation in the euro area. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it can be achieved. </p>
<p>The second piece of good news actually concerns Spain, that Spain has completed <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 90% of its funding programme for the sovereign. </p>
<p>So, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> remove tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> but ultimately, the initiative is in the hands of governments. </p>
<p>But certainly when you see two subsidiaries of the same company located in two different countries and paying completely different interest rates for their borrowing, when you see exactly the same individual borrower, say a young couple that wants to buy a flat, and paying a completely different interest rate on mortgages, then you start asking yourself, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> there is a problem here. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-11-08</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>We should not <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> this readjustment of prices, which is actually welcome, with deflation. </p>
<p>OMTs are, as you know, a fully effective backstop that is devised to remove the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the euro area, and we stand ready to act. </p>
<p>Certainly the outlook is being <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> ; as you know, the European Commission has released its forecast, and there is a picture of a weaker economy, as I had the chance to say yesterday. </p>
<p>On inflation, I think I have always said, at least in the recent past, that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced because, on the one hand, you have the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that come from the weak level of economic activity and high unemployment. </p>
<p>The important thing with the LTROs was that, again, we removed tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> coming from the lack of funding that would have happened in the first quarter of this year. </p>
<p>You see asset prices going up and down, and to infer from an increase in the price of one asset that inflation will go up, and that inflation will go up because of OMTs, which have n't created any liquidity yet, is really a very rash <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span>. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a sign of either of the two factors. </p>
<p>They are a device to remove tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, while -- at the same time -- not removing incentives for fiscal discipline, and delivering price stability. </p>
<p>But, certainly, these must be the two reasons: either they are fearful to lend -- and here we are talking about banks that do not have capital constraints of course -- so, <span class='uncertainty'>assuming</span> that they do not have any capital constraints, banks do not lend because either the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion is too high or because there is no demand. </p>
<p>On the first question, you are asking me: <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> there be an OMT without conditionality? </p>
<p>On the other hand, you have the upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that come from energy prices and the widespread use of indirect taxation, especially VAT, by countries that need to consolidate their budgets. </p>
<p>Whether banks return LTRO because they do not lend it because of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion or because credit demand is weak, I am not in a position to say today. </p>
<p>Let me first make a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span>, because there has been a lot of press on this point in the last week. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> certainly be partly the consequence of an increase in productivity, which, as the economists you mentioned correctly say, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be cyclical. </p>
<p>You are also right when you say that, in spite of the changes in unit labour costs in some countries, we do not observe comparable changes in the GDP deflator, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be due to other reasons. </p>
<p>So, even though overall it continues to be a small <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> with respect to euro area banks and with respect to what it was at the beginning of last year, it is going up. </p>
<p>This has to do with my answer to your point about the supervisory mechanism and who <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> chair it. </p>
<p>Again, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on your perspective, because if you compare the current speed of reform with the speed of reform in those countries in the previous five years, then you are bound to say that it is very fast. </p>
<p>On the first question: we look at price stability and we will decide on our strategy and the timing of our exit <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on how we see price stability over the medium term. </p>
<p>Why this should <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on OMTs is a mystery to me. </p>
<p>To ask whether the price of a specific asset forecasts an increase in the inflation rate is always a very <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> question. </p>
<p>The first <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> is purely factual: the nominal amount of collateral being posted was not EUR 80 billion, but EUR 10 billion. </p>
<p>The second <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> is that all this had no impact at all on our lending. </p>
<p>So, all this basically poises the euro area for a recovery, which should be, or <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> is going to be, slow, gradual but also solid, looking exactly at these fundamentals. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2012-12-06</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>There is also a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception issue, the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception that comes from the deteriorating quality of your counterparty that can not be addressed by the funding facilities. </p>
<p>So, when the position was taken that the new ESM <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be used to fill holes created by legacy assets which had gone sour, I think one has to define exactly what these legacy assets are. </p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum you have what we call mutualisation of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>Banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not lend to the economy because of funding problems -- and they have been addressed, because of capital shortages and, to some extent, they too have been addressed by the banks themselves because a significant amount of capital has been raised in the last two years. </p>
<p>On the second question, we said that the main aim of the OMT is to remove tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to overcome monetary and financial fragmentation of the euro area that would stem from a redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>They know they will have to have in place either a full EFSF/ESM macroeconomic adjustment programme or a <span class='uncertainty'>precautionary</span> programme. </p>
<p>The final assessment of the European Ombudsman is still <span class='uncertainty'>pending</span>. </p>
<p>Also, what is most important in this latest agreement is the medium-term commitment to <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> providing new money if Greece were to have a primary surplus, but for some reason things were not going well, and not because of a lack of compliance with the programme. </p>
<p>I said that, in a sense, it is quite natural that you have different credit costs in different parts of the Monetary Union, costs reflecting the different degrees of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen that I am not the only central banker who is a member of the Group of Thirty. </p>
<p>I have been clear since the very first press conference on the ECB 's conditions for accepting this task -- namely that it should be in a position to carry it out in a decisive, firm, complete and strong manner without any reputational <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And, I have always said that the only way to mitigate the impact of this budgetary consolidation, which is contractionary in the short term, is to undertake structural reforms that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase competitiveness and exports, as well as create jobs and growth. </p>
<p>We briefly touched upon the complexities that such measure would involve and on <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> unintended consequences. </p>
<p>But there is a degree, a range, beyond which I said that there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, such as redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, that make these differences unacceptable. </p>
<p>The ECB should not have the reputational <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that often comes with supervision. </p>
<p>This is much more than anything you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> achieve by reducing the short-term policy rate. </p>
<p>If you consider that before the summer we did not even have an idea of what this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> look like. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-01-10</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>And, finally, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that ensuring price stability actually gives you the long-term foundation for growth and job creation. </p>
<p>Another observation is that, when you look at output gaps, the significant levels of output gaps would justify lower levels of inflation than we actually have, which again <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there are certain structural components in the unemployment rate. </p>
<p>On the second question, we are pleased not so much that the yields are going down, but about the fact that tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have been removed and this has led to an improvement in financial market conditions and the beginning of a stabilisation and return of confidence in the financial markets. </p>
<p>Third, the principle of a single voice is essential and markets have understood it very well -- at least it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to economic activity, you are right, they stem essentially from a lack of action by the governments on the fiscal side ; by this I mean that not only is continuing fiscal consolidation essential, but it also needs to be implemented in a balanced way, through a proper combination of government expenditure reduction, and taxation. </p>
<p>The lack of capital also <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have improved significantly. </p>
<p>I do not yet see any <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of exuberance because, after all, we are now back in a normal situation, from a financial viewpoint, but we are not at all seeing an early or strong recovery. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Conditionally</span> with an ESM and an IMF presence means that countries have to act ; it means that OMTs do not start without programmes. </p>
<p>Banks do not lend for three reasons: one is lack of funding, the second is lack of capital and the third is either <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion or credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>So we are now left with high <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion and credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> -- credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> caused by the recession itself. </p>
<p>The work is not finished, as your friend <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to say, and should continue, and that is very much in the hands of national supervisors. </p>
<p>As regards your first question there are several issues with and several angles from which you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> look at unemployment, but just keep in mind that our mandate is not full employment, unlike the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>The size of the ECB 's balance sheet, which is often considered as a source of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, is continuing to shrink ! </p>
<p>The present situation is characterized by high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> stems, as I said before, from geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, from the price of oil, from commodity prices and from the policies of the governments. </p>
<p>Then we will certainly <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the situation after that, and we will see whether the steps we have taken are really satisfactory, because, as I said at the beginning, we are taking this very seriously. </p>
<p>We speak a lot about contagion when things go poorly, but I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there is also contagion, positive contagion, when things go well. </p>
<p>`` We reiterate that access <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. '' </p>
<p>However, there are, here and there, some signs which we are watching carefully, that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there is some exuberance in specific localised parts of the financial system. </p>
<p>Stock market prices have increased and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is at a historical low. </p>
<p>The two LTROs have avoided a disorderly deleveraging, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have had even worse consequences for credit flows and caused further disruption in economic activity. </p>
<p>I do n't think that 's where the problem is, contrary to what the issue was at the beginning of last year when there was a serious potential for serious distress and systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> materialising. </p>
<p>On the LTRO, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that funding conditions right now are satisfactory. </p>
<p>On the first question, the combination of LTROs with the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of using additional credit claims as collateral -- which we had before the Bank of England actually launched the scheme -- is very much the same kind of action. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-02-07</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>It simply says that many banks had accessed LTRO for <span class='uncertainty'>precautionary</span> reasons because they were, a year ago, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span> about the liquidity situation -- about the funding prospects. </p>
<p>If you go back and look at whether there is a one-to-one relationship between 200 and a certain level of EONIA, the answer is that it is certainly changing over time because of many other different factors: <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, financial markets and other kinds of development. </p>
<p>However, as I said last time, the exchange rate is not a policy target, but it is important for growth and price stability, and we will certainly want to see whether the appreciation is sustained and will alter our <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment as far as price stability is concerned. </p>
<p>If you have any <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about that, you also have the IMF team who was in Italy for a financial sector assessment. </p>
<p>Third, I would not make too much of the recent increase in the EONIA because it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be due to a variety of factors, some of which are structural, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on which banks have repaid the LTRO. </p>
<p>But there are also other factors like <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>So, within that context, the IMF has publicly stated that their <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> view is" that the Bank of Italy took timely and appropriate action, within the limits of the legal framework, to address problems at MPS. </p>
<p>Banks would and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be resolved in a uniform way in the euro area -- or potentially and preferably in the European Union. </p>
<p>And now they are less <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>, than they were a year ago. </p>
<p>On the SSM, let me go step by step, because <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> you have <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> accelerations in the perception of how the SSM is being put in place. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that small banks are tighter than large banks. </p>
<p>At the same time, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that all the actions we have taken will in the end find their way through to the economy, so much so that we foresee a recovery, a gradual recovery, in the second part of this year. </p>
<p>The ECB commissioned Promontory Financial Group to conduct a study on a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> organisation of the future supervisory function. </p>
<p>Again, the fact that we use the additional credit claims as a further way to provide collateral means that we have now addressed the funding issues -- we can not address the shortage of capital and we can not address the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion that has indeed reached high levels. </p>
<p>We welcome the Liikanen Report, whereby especially <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> trading activities are being ring-fenced to some extent. </p>
<p>I should also add that the various initiatives do not <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> amongst themselves in such a radical way as to rule out this eventual convergence. </p>
<p>So, I agree with you that separation is essential, but frankly I do n't agree with you about MPS and the future SSM being linked in any <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> way other than me being former governor of Banca d'Italia and now being president of the ECB. </p>
<p>The number of staff will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the actual structure and therefore can not be defined properly yet. </p>
<p>It is quite obvious that we can not afford to have our own separate legislations ; we will eventually have to converge on one rule for the euro area, and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> for the European Union. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-03-07</b>, 22 sentences</p></div><p>However, stock prices went up all over, and in other countries, such as the United States, this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have to do with the increased prospects of a recovery. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that as soon as you hear any gossip or see" friendly fire '', you come over and check with us first, before writing about something that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not exist. </p>
<p>And that 's going to be another factor which gradually, by the year end <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span>, will also contribute to this recovery. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, for example, have discordant views within a particular government. </p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean by <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the single supervisor. </p>
<p>And as I have said on other occasions, many people <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to underestimate the amount of political capital that European leaders have invested in the euro. </p>
<p>To the first question: yes, we have discussed the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of doing it. </p>
<p>I think there is a date when this is going to be done, and I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is at the end of the year, but I can not let you know for sure </p>
<p>We are actually seeing a dichotomy between the hard data which, as you said a moment ago, are on average disappointing and a broad indicator of soft data, of survey data, of sentiment data, which <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> uniformly are positive. </p>
<p>... <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices, indirect taxes as well as higher oil prices, and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> stemming from weaker economic activity. '' </p>
<p>We have not observed changes in prices that would indicate <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of either inflation or deflation. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the ECB has some value to add to it in its field of competence, namely the financial sector. </p>
<p>And I think that is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> what Madame Lagarde was <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> to the Irish government. </p>
<p>Obviously it is not a very liquid market and, at times, it is also <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>, so one has to treat this observation with some caution. </p>
<p>The third reason is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, and now it is quite clear that with the deteriorating economy, the non-performing loans increase and <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion by the banks goes up and further restricts lending. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say a few more things about credit and fragmentation later, but I 'm just responding to your specific question. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be another Angst, by the way, our alleged lower level of political independence. </p>
<p>And to use a word which I have used in the past, namely" contagion '' -- by the way, I saw it was misinterpreted, I meant contagion between financial markets, and not positive contagion from the financial markets to the real economy where I have been always careful in explaining that it is actually lagging -- you have seen, certainly, that the contagion to other countries has been muted this time, contrary to what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have happened about a year and a half ago, and this is another positive sign. </p>
<p>There are two considerations: Cyprus ' economy is a small economy, but the systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be small. </p>
<p>For an exact assessment, I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> you read the second Eurogroup statement, hinting at the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of a programme by the second half of March. </p>
<p>Again, if I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give you some data, that would be good. </p>
<p>OMT was meant as an effective back-stop that will remove, and has removed, the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> from the euro area. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-04-04</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>With regard to your question on the <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> in Italy I have no comments. </p>
<p>However, I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually have a partial answer. </p>
<p>A draft directive is now under discussion in the European Council and the European Parliament that specifies a pecking order of the categories of asset holders that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be bailed-in. </p>
<p>In the euro area we have only a small share of financial intermediation taking place via capital markets, and a large share, <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> 80%, taking place via the banking system. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Volatility</span> went down again by about 30%. </p>
<p>I am sure that the European Commission has done a splendid job on both accounts and the Council is now called to sign these two proposals, so that they can enter into force as soon as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, because we have seen that they are crucial for stability. </p>
<p>With the OMTs, the interest rates on a ten-year bond went down from 7.39% to 4.87% today for Spain, and from 6.45% to 4.52% for Italy, and in Germany interest rates on the ten-year Bund actually went up from 1.25% to 1.46% before the current <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> drove them down again. </p>
<p>We had PSI in Greece, we had the EBA stress test, we had the redenomination of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and then we had -- most importantly -- the enormous amount of bank bonds coming due in the first quarter of 2012. </p>
<p>That is the sort of advice one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> give. </p>
<p>The other thing that points to a slight decrease in fragmentation is that the dispersion in the rate of growth of deposits -- the cross-country dispersion or standard <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> -- is going down and is actually half of what it was before OMTs. </p>
<p>Domestic demand turned out to be weaker than expected, essentially because of the heightened <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and lack of confidence. </p>
<p>First of all, the Single Supervisory Mechanism -LRB- SSM -RRB- would not actually call for a mutualisation of losses, so it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually speedily proceed. </p>
<p>Being" out '' does n't mean the country avoids the need for action, but exiting entails many <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, big <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>In addition, I think the ECB has shown its determination to fight any redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, and OMTs, with their precise rules, are there for this purpose. </p>
<p>So this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also go ahead speedily. </p>
<p>Second, we now have confirmation that the HICP is edging down, to well below 2%, although with some <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and certainly <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on energy prices and exchange rate developments. </p>
<p>Our monetary policy will remain accommodative -- do not forget that the EONIA, the very short-term interest rate, is standing at about 7 basis points, or at 6 basis points now, which is <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> zero. </p>
<p>As you now know, because I have said it several times, banks do not lend because of lack of funding, lack of capital or <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion. </p>
<p>I would also add that the euro area national central banks <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> play a role. </p>
<p>In other words, when you have a very important share of financial intermediation taking place through capital markets, then you have assets that, potentially, the central bank <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decide to buy. </p>
<p>We will continue studying various <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> for action, but you should always remember that both our institutional set-up and the experience of other countries tell us that we have to think deeply before we can come up with something that is useful, feasible, and consistent with our mandate. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of how markets have reacted to the events in Cyprus: today 's data show that TARGET2 balances continue to decline and that slightly less than 50% of the net amount injected by the LTROs has been repaid -- proving wrong all those who thought that huge <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were taken with the LTROs. </p>
<p>When we come to looking at the credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, it is quite clear that all these actors have a role to play. </p>
<p>Let me answer to the first question, which really addresses both standard and non-standard measures that the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take. </p>
<p>A bail-in in itself is not a problem: it is the lack of ex ante rules known to all parties and the lack of capital buffers or other" bail-inable '' assets that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> make a bail-in a disorderly event. </p>
<p>It objected to extending ELA to non-viable banks and thus did not replace what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been fiscal action. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-05-02</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>The bank lending survey and the survey of small and medium-sized enterprises -LRB- SMEs -RRB- <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that the dominant factor explaining the low demand for credit is macroeconomic <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, and this goes together with <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, which actually plays a role on both sides, it affects both supply and demand. </p>
<p>On the supply side, you have, predominantly, the issue of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion. </p>
<p>On the lending side, progress is more muted, but here I would point out something that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a source of comfort. </p>
<p>Third, the banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> ask for an interest rate that is so high, that the SME has to say" thanks, but no thanks ''. </p>
<p>The OMT programme removed the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and has been a very powerful instrument in this regard, but we should not forget that the funding crisis that the banks experienced dating back to mid-2011 caused a credit contraction, of which we are victims even today. </p>
<p>We have 17 countries and the business cycles of these 17 countries are not exactly the same ; they are not synchronous and they <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> very much across the area. </p>
<p>So, the monetary policy measures which can benefit some countries <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not benefit others. </p>
<p>And this progress is documented by the fact that domestic deposits continue to increase in all the banks of all the stressed countries, or <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all I think. </p>
<p>The two longer-term refinancing operations avoided a worsening, or even a collapse I think, of the situation and then the OMT programme removed the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the euro area. </p>
<p>This has been increasing and increasing and now it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be stable, or at least the values of the dispersion are no longer going up. </p>
<p>The third thing to consider is the information provided by the survey of small and medium-sized enterprises -LRB- SMEs -RRB-, which is in a sense to me <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most important source of information. </p>
<p>Second is that SMEs <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be given an amount which is lower than the amount they asked for. </p>
<p>However, it is predominantly <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion that makes supply tight. </p>
<p>Incidentally, we have not seen any of the awful, terrible <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that were <span class='uncertainty'>predicted</span> at the time. </p>
<p>So, no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>On the second point of your question, on whether the ECB would take <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> onto its balance sheet, I have actually gone through that a moment ago, and I think that I have shown you how far more difficult this problem is in Europe than it is in the United States. </p>
<p>The deleveraging process is not something that only banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to do in some countries, but it is also something that a bank 's clients <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to do. </p>
<p>We are looking at all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> options, we are aware of the importance of this and we are also aware of what we can do and what we can not do. </p>
<p>There are several unintended consequences that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> stem from this measure. </p>
<p>A bank issued a bond in Munich and in Milan, an uncollateralised senior bond, so not a covered bond, and there was spread of <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> 150 or 200 basis points between the two. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this measure is going to be fully effective for at least two reasons. </p>
<p>Second, there was the expectation, that self-fulfilling expectations of a disruptive scenario, or what we call tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, would gain momentum. </p>
<p>And there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that significant progress has been made in terms of fiscal consolidation throughout the entire euro area. </p>
<p>Therefore, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to take action to mitigate the contractionary effects of this. </p>
<p>The other is that the weakness in economic activity and the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> price stability projections for the medium term are also now affecting not only non-core economies, where one <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have had <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about the monetary policy transmission mechanisms, but also core economies, where these issues never existed. </p>
<p>So this measure is addressed to a broad set of banks, and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is going to be more effective today than it would have been a few months ago. </p>
<p>At the same time, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that restricting the interest rate corridor will also dampen the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the EONIA rate. </p>
<p>When you consider all this, you look at what assets <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be purchased and then you look at what sort of financial infrastructure the Europeans have. </p>
<p>However, now that there is more time, there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a shift towards reducing current government expenditure and lowering taxes. </p>
<p>Of course, I say" gradual '', because given the seriousness and the gravity of the previous situation, you would not expect such a change to take place all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span>. </p>
<p>By the way, let me say that our thinking is very much in a <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> stage, given the complexity of the issue, so we have not reached any conclusion either way. </p>
<p>Finally, for banks that finance themselves in the interbank market, the EONIA is around 6 -7 basis points, i.e. <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> zero. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-06-06</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>But you have to look through <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and you need to ask yourself how inflation expectations are behaving. </p>
<p>You are all aware of these <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views, but we are relatively confident that this can be overcome in time. </p>
<p>I can continue with this: <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> indices. </p>
<p>You have different views in all central banks and in a period of such great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> you obviously have a variety of opinions. </p>
<p>You can have disagreements about certain measures but <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> perceptions about the other measures I mentioned, namely ABSs, very long-term refinancing operations, enhancement of additional credit claims, collateral and so on and so forth. </p>
<p>While one studies and explores ideas there will obviously be changes of views and your own view <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> change during the discussion. </p>
<p>We will then certainly look into the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of accepting it as collateral. </p>
<p>Of course, the falling price of oil is very important because now we really have to understand whether it is a structural fall in price, i.e. whether it is going to stay because of the shale gas in the United States and elsewhere -LRB- as <span class='uncertainty'>apparently</span> it is not only in the United States -RRB-, or whether it is something transitory. </p>
<p>Also, monetary policy has to look beyond <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> which, as I think I said in the introductory statement, is going to continue to be present in price developments -- so do not be surprised if you see bumps in the price paths in the months ahead, because there is going to be <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> there. </p>
<p>Even before the crisis, ABSs for SME loans were very little, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the smallest component of the ABS market, if I am not mistaken. </p>
<p>However, often this mea culpa is in fact, as I will call it, a mistake of historical projection, i.e. you <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to judge the past by today 's standards. </p>
<p>There was a fear of contagion there and very high <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>When we all look back at what OMT has produced, frankly when you look at the data, it 's really very hard not to state that OMT has been <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most successful monetary policy measure undertaken in recent time. </p>
<p>But, certainly, we have observed an increase in global <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, coming from major monetary policy decisions or announcements of decisions that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be taken in the coming months. </p>
<p>Before OMT we had some expectations of deflationary <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and that 's over. </p>
<p>In answer to the first question, we continue to experience a decrease in excess liquidity, we continue to experience LTRO repayments, and these repayments have currently reached <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 60%, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> slightly below 60%, of the net injection that took place in the early months of 2012. </p>
<p>On the second question, one reason why banks do not lend is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, which is both micro, with respect to their clients, and macro, with respect to the general economic environment and the high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that still prevails in some parts of the euro area. </p>
<p>There are people who are convinced that TARGET2 balances are a big <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for countries. </p>
<p>As far as the ECB is concerned, we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that a gradual recovery will gain ground, albeit at low levels, in the second part of this year. </p>
<p>The answer you get is that the net rate of return, adjusted for the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of lending, is not high enough for them to lend. </p>
<p>But the perception of macroeconomic <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is still there, and that is a question of time. </p>
<p>That is also a good thing, because we, unlike other central banks, can gradually downsize our balance sheet without having to take any decisions that would, or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, create <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>On the second point, what is happening in the rest of the world is, as someone said before, having consequences on <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and interest rates all along the yield curves, and we will certainly look at that in our monetary policy decisions, in the discussion of the monetary policy decisions, but our monetary policy is completely independent. </p>
<p>Finally, I am sure you have not forgotten that, in the early months of 2012, how some people were saying how big, immense were the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we were undertaking with these measures. </p>
<p>Have we seen any of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> materialise? </p>
<p>Exports have increased in <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all countries, especially in Germany, Spain and Italy. </p>
<p>The data should prove to these people that now the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are lower after OMT. </p>
<p>As I have said several times, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> like labour market flexibility has been placed squarely only on the shoulders of the young population, which is one of the major reasons why youth unemployment is so high in some countries. </p>
<p>As of cyclical factors,, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the labour market in general is experiencing the combined effects of a credit crunch and the unavoidable fiscal consolidation that many of these countries have had to undertake. </p>
<p>In response to the first question, frankly the ECB has not done anything to increase <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the markets. </p>
<p>However, other measures, such as a negative rate on the deposit facility, which we also discussed and are now technically ready for, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span>, as I have said on numerous occasions, have several unintended consequences. </p>
<p>This question implies a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that I am going to tell you exactly what we are going to do about the main refinancing operations. </p>
<p>At today 's meeting, we had an ample discussion on the various non-standard measures that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be utilised to repair the monetary policy transmission channels. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-07-04</b>, 28 sentences</p></div><p>Yes, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span>. </p>
<p>And, frankly, it is too early to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on further developments in the communication now. </p>
<p>There are several aspects of the ABS market that need to be taken care of before it becomes a realistic <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>, and both institutions are actively working on that. </p>
<p>We want to clarify as much as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> our assessment of the medium term outlook for inflation and what our reaction functions are. </p>
<p>One of the points of discussion is how we best react to any increase in <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, not caused by our own actions, but by something else that is happening in the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Is it going to be a transitory change, is it going to be just short term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, or are we in the presence of significant, permanent changes? </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the exchange rate is important for price stability and for growth. </p>
<p>I am not sure I actually spoke of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> coming from the strength of the euro. </p>
<p>If a jurisdiction, if a country, if a monetary area embarks on an asset quality review or stress test, or any examination of the state of health of a banking system, the result of which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be to identify capital shortfalls, it is absolutely essential that both markets and supervisors and governments know what is going to be done about these shortfalls. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that yesterday and today you have had occasion to read what the Minister of Economy and Finance said in the Italian parliament. </p>
<p>What happened in the last month is the monetary tightening that has taken place in various segments of the interest rate curve, in the presence of a by and large continuing weakness in the economy, in spite of the new soft indicators which <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to point not towards a dramatic improvement, but towards a slower pace of worsening of the economy. </p>
<p>On the precise amount, I can not really make any comment: first of all, because it is a decision of the Member States ; and second, because it is a decision that has to be calibrated vis-à-vis the eventual shortfalls that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come up. </p>
<p>For example, if you issue in foreign currency, you want to hedge yourself against the exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>What the Governing Council did today was to inject a downward bias in interest rates for the foreseeable future linked to its assessment of these three sets of <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>. </p>
<p>Together with the sense of the length of time, you also have to look at three sets of economic <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, namely the medium-term outlook for inflation, the economy and monetary dynamics. </p>
<p>To mention some of them, on the one hand we had some monetary tightening in the main monetary <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>. </p>
<p>But, at this point in time, we do not see these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and we see all the factors that have led us to express this new forward guidance. </p>
<p>I have just said, it is meant to address the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of the euro area. </p>
<p>OMTs were conceived, designed and meant to address tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the euro area. </p>
<p>We have the national backstops and we have the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> for countries to apply for an ESM programme. </p>
<p>And, incidentally, I think the outcome of this exercise has been quite satisfactory and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually form a good example. </p>
<p>We also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that exchange rates are not a one-way affair, whereby you simply click something and you change the exchange rate. </p>
<p>With regard to the first question, we had an extensive discussion about a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> interest rate cut. </p>
<p>Having said that, I think we would all agree that low levels of interest rates entail serious <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for financial stability. </p>
<p>On the first point, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the outlook for inflation in the medium term is such that it justifies this new way of communicating, this forward guidance. </p>
<p>On the second question, a review is currently under way so it would not be appropriate for me to comment on <span class='uncertainty'>speculations</span> regarding the outcome. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we have seen that our baseline scenario, which foresees a gradual recovery by the end of the year, <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be gradually being confirmed by a variety of soft indicators coming out on the positive side. </p>
<p>But, as I said, two other backstops are potentially usable to meet the shortfalls that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> emerge from the asset quality review. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-08-01</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>I prefaced my remarks on the minutes, or the communication, by saying that at this stage I have to be very, very <span class='uncertainty'>unspecific</span>. </p>
<p>Also, we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about putting forward our own personal views on what we would like to see, for two reasons: first of all because it is a highly complex discussion in our specific institutional set-up ; and second, because it is one of those decisions on which there truly has to be a consensus. </p>
<p>I think you have all the parameters in your hands to judge the length of time and especially to judge when the language on forward guidance <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be changed. </p>
<p>We still have a lot of work to do on that front, but we are <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> starting to see the first signs that this significant improvement in confidence and in interest rates is finding its way through to the economy. </p>
<p>In other words, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on which rates you compare the current ones with. </p>
<p>And this outlook <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on economic activity and on money and credit developments. </p>
<p>I think that they were effective in compressing <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and, given the fact that it is very hard to assess the effectiveness of such measures in the midst of a great deal of other communication -- quite, I would say, abundant and powerful communications from a variety of sources -- I would definitely say they were successful in terms of compressing <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and that they were partly successful in terms of interest rates, short-term rates. </p>
<p>We know that there are several reasons for this: first and foremost, weak economic demand, second, heightened credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and, third, continued deleveraging by households and enterprises. </p>
<p>As I have said, current data confirm our baseline scenario, and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the downside. </p>
<p>But as I said these are <span class='uncertainty'>tentative</span> signs. </p>
<p>Incoming survey data in July showed some further improvement from low levels and <span class='uncertainty'>tentatively</span> confirmed the expected stabilisation. </p>
<p>We are members of a 17-country euro area, so it is especially important that any modifications we introduce do not put at <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> or call into question the independence of the members of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>What he meant to say is that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to repeat it every month because we are not sure that you would actually get it unless we do so. </p>
<p>To have consistent treatment means to enhance <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> equivalence across all eligible assets. </p>
<p>In other words, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> that the signs we are seeing now confirm the baseline scenario of the ECB staff projections for the second part of the year. </p>
<p>It says:" recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and <span class='uncertainty'>tentatively</span> confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity '' in the second part of the year. </p>
<p>So, in other words, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not repeat the words if we are convinced that you and the markets understand that, if we do not say anything, it does not mean that we have changed our mind. </p>
<p>But we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not repeat them if we judge that you and the markets understand that a certain forward guidance is valid until further notice. </p>
<p>First, spreads narrowed, rates fell, <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> became significantly lower. </p>
<p>But all in all the picture <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be better than it was a year ago. </p>
<p>The interest rate channel, because interest rates went down, and the confidence channel, because <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> went down. </p>
<p>More generally, the OMT programme has reduced the general <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span> in the euro area, as shown by a variety of indicators. </p>
<p>So, we have given forward guidance that said that, based on our medium-term outlook for inflation, <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on economic activity and money and credit, interest rates are expected to stay where they are or go lower. </p>
<p>Another example is: we looked at covered bonds and there we distinguish now between retained ones that are more <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> and therefore deserve a higher haircut and non-retained ones that are less <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> and therefore have a lower haircut. </p>
<p>The point is that if we repeat it every month, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> infer from this that actually it is not forward guidance for an extended period of time but only for a month. </p>
<p>Furthermore, following the general reduction in <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span>, we saw a reduction in the size of the ECB 's balance sheet, as well as a significant reduction in <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia if we look at what happened on the stock markets and, in general, capital markets. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-09-05</b>, 29 sentences</p></div><p>We certainly stand ready to act, whichever source these developments <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> derive from. </p>
<p>And it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come from all over, in which case the forward guidance is meant to make sure that you want to look through this news to make sure that their impact on the medium-term assessment of inflation is contained </p>
<p>The ECB 's Monthly Bulletin speaks of a figure between $ 200 billion and $ 100 billion, but in general the threshold <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the state of fragmentation. </p>
<p>We certainly are alert to the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come out of the Syrian situation and to the economic <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> derive from the emerging market situation, which are two different things, really. </p>
<p>Now, we have got to be aware that excess liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on two factors. </p>
<p>So the very fact of saying it is itself a very powerful <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> of our reaction function. </p>
<p>The first is to reduce the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> within the corridor, which we have succeeded -LSB- in doing -RSB-. </p>
<p>On the second point, on Greece, the current adjustment programme for Greece expires at the end of 2014, so this leaves some time for the Eurogroup to decide on a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> extension of the current programme and to assess the prospects of Greece regaining access to capital markets. </p>
<p>We went through this when we had the discussions about Greece <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> a year or a year and a half ago. </p>
<p>It is crucial that an appropriate framework is in place to safeguard the achievements made and to avoid potential <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to full market access once the programme has been completed. </p>
<p>As you can observe, when we look at the nature or the composition of the beginning of a recovery, I am very, very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about the recovery. </p>
<p>That is very important because if it continues, it gives a sense that the <span class='uncertainty'>dependence</span> of the recovery on the rest of the world is <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> balanced by domestic demand. </p>
<p>A decision will be taken in due time about the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> successor programme. </p>
<p>It really <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on who is repaying the LTRO, what is the state of their funding conditions, what is the state of their profitability, what is their general situation. </p>
<p>I do n't think Mr Asmussen has ever said that, and there has been <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation are broadly balanced and one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is precisely shocks in commodity prices. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the context ; it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the degree of fragmentation that we have. </p>
<p>It scores very well on having controlled <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and reduced the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> within the corridor and it scores ok in controlling the levels of rates. </p>
<p>Work is going on, and as I have said it is important, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> - if it 's well done - it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually give more light and transparency on the nature of our discussions. </p>
<p>Some banks have made steady progress in reducing their <span class='uncertainty'>dependence</span> on wholesale funding under the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>There will be a first full communication on the assets -- also called the" asset quality review '' -- which in fact is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment, a balance sheet assessment, by mid-October. </p>
<p>First of all, financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are often addressed by macro-prudential tools. </p>
<p>In response to your second question, the practice for, I would say, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all, if not all, supervisors in the euro area is the following. </p>
<p>In other words, we do not see <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to financial stability that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> originate from the too low levels of interest rates at the present time. </p>
<p>And they will decide what to do, because it is up to them, as they are using, or <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be using, public money, or they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be considering that the further bail-in <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be feasible. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> on this point. </p>
<p>It 's powerful because it addresses a realistic objective, namely redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> spreads -- the spreads that are derived from redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Supervisors ca n't have responsibilities that pertain or <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> pertain to the taxpayer. </p>
<p>We do not view now movements in interest rates as a realistic way to respond to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in financial stability that we do not see. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-10-02</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>There was a discussion and, as last time, some governors observed that improvements in the economy would not justify this discussion but other governors <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that the discussion was warranted. </p>
<p>The excess liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on several factors, one of which is the state of fragmentation. </p>
<p>On the backstops, another thing that quite astonishes me is the <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> that have been expressed about whether national backstops will be in place by the time we start the SSM. </p>
<p>And my second question would be: if you consider changing the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment of certain securities for banks, to hand in to the ECB as collateral, do you envision a scarcity of collateral <span class='uncertainty'>sometime</span> in the future? </p>
<p>The draft proposal by the Commission contains the three elements which we have always <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> to be important, namely a single mechanism, a single authority and a single fund financed by the industry − by the banking industry. </p>
<p>Heightened <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion is another factor which is very important. </p>
<p>All in all, when you look at periods of <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> − and we have seen them in Greece, and in Portugal and we are seeing them in Italy now − you see that, while <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be hampering the hopes for a recovery in these countries, it does not really hurt the euro area, the foundations of the euro area, as it used to do a few years ago. </p>
<p>As I have said, an LTRO is just one of them and when the time comes, we will decide what will be the best shape that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have. </p>
<p>Where we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> from the Commission 's proposal is that we view the two phases, namely that of assessing the non-viability of a certain bank in question and that of deciding which action should be undertaken as clearly separate tasks. </p>
<p>We also <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that 114 -LRB- of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union -RRB- provides a sufficient basis for the creation of the single resolution mechanism -LRB- SRM -RRB-. </p>
<p>This is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> one of the reasons why the <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> has produced some movements, but not dramatic movements. </p>
<p>The ECB <span class='uncertainty'>believes</span> that it should only be an observer, just to make sure that two phases are completely separate. </p>
<p>So the present inflation rates are not <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>, and I have explained the reasons there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>I will repeat it if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> in my own words. </p>
<p>So, everything <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that Spain will approach this exercise well-equipped, but of course it 's very difficult to guess at this point in time what can happen at individual banks. </p>
<p>If it were to be protracted, it would certainly pose a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the recovery in the United States and the world. </p>
<p>Current opinions about the different <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span> of government bonds are what they are, namely personal opinions which address a clear issue, the different <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span> of government bonds. </p>
<p>Well, the US budget shutdown is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, if it is protracted. </p>
<p>The asset quality review and the stress tests are foreseen to be concluded before the ECB takes over the SSM -- which means by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> the end of next year -- and we all, I, the Governing Council, collectively strongly hope that credit will have recovered by then. </p>
<p>It is fear and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that has produced fragmentation. </p>
<p>It does not say anything about the current discussion of levels of exchange rates, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, by definition, not be achieved per se in a regime of floating currencies. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> they are aware, and this awareness often needs to be translated into actual action. </p>
<p>This is a comment I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make in general, and the President has made it many times for the euro area in general. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-11-07</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>And it is also true that as the recovery gains momentum, we also see the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of a return to our inflation expectations level. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> Vítor has a longer memory? </p>
<p>First of all, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this decrease in interest rates is effective, and we are seeing market reactions to this effect. </p>
<p>In other words, you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well have a situation where you think that you are at say 1% inflation but, instead, it turns out that you are actually at minus 2%. </p>
<p>First of all, they very wisely thought about <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> measurement errors in HICP data, so they wanted to keep a significant cushion between price behaviour and deflation. </p>
<p>There are also some more technical reasons why this is effective: clearly, it reduces the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the EONIA because it restricts the corridor. </p>
<p>So there are various reasons to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that both today 's decisions and our forward guidance have been effective. </p>
<p>The EONIA <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuates</span> between the deposit rate and the main refinancing rate, so the <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuation</span> range is unaffected by the level of the marginal lending rate. </p>
<p>And so, the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of having imbalances was always being looked at and considered. </p>
<p>We certainly want banks that do the right deleveraging of non-performing loans and other non-performing assets, but I do n't think that is <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> ; the markets were already actively asking for it. </p>
<p>I mentioned some of them before but, in principle, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even cut the interest rate, the MRO rate, further. </p>
<p>So, if there were to be a change, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> change. </p>
<p>On the first point: as the introductory statement says, taking into account today 's decision, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced for inflation. </p>
<p>Well, why did, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> I say, our founding fathers actually want to have something below but close to 2%? </p>
<p>So the main discussion was whether to act today or not, with a view to some <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> action in the future. </p>
<p>So as we come out of that and we see the extent of what we call the three <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> -- political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, economic <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and financial <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> -- we see that, broadly speaking, these three categories are decreasing significantly in the euro area. </p>
<p>We are also confident that as the overall economic situation improves, fragmentation will also decrease, because let us not forget that fragmentation began with a very high <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception, both by the core countries towards the stressed countries for a variety of reasons but also by the very same banks in the stressed countries vis-à-vis the private sector in those countries. </p>
<p>All these things have changed the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception with respect to sovereign debt. </p>
<p>I think that, in all these countries, of course to <span class='uncertainty'>varying</span> degrees, significant progress has been made. </p>
<p>And these went hand in hand with some other changes in the euro area, especially changes in <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception which took place in 2011. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we have contributed to shortening this protracted period of time with today 's decision. </p>
<p>The ECB and the other institutions -- the IMF and the Commission -- would say that it would certainly be useful to have a <span class='uncertainty'>precautionary</span> programme in place, although it is also true to say that the success has been quite significant. </p>
<p>After that, while we continue to observe improvements in market performance across the board, both interest rates and <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> indices, etc., we are actually observing that this improvement has stopped. </p>
<p>So, there were four or five points of <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span>, of fine tuning of the framework, with the main change being the definition of the objective, which before did not have this idea of below, but close to, 2%. </p>
<p>What we are pretty sure of is that the forward guidance has been effective in reducing the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of money market rates. </p>
<p>Other members of the Governing Council said that the incoming data in the next month <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also provide further information and so they reserved their views for next month. </p>
<p>If you look at the euro area from a distance, you see that the fundamentals in this area are <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the strongest in the world. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2013-12-05</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>First of all, some of them, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> both of them, are not in place yet, so they are not laws. </p>
<p>So, that 's the state of play and it 's too early to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on such future courses of action. </p>
<p>Your second question -- which instrument would we deploy against which <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> -- is actually a very hard question to answer, and we have n't really reflected on that. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> we do -- like last time. </p>
<p>My answer to your first question is no, meaning that we had a brief discussion which was not in any great depth and did not touch on any technical aspect of this <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> measure. </p>
<p>So it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>. </p>
<p>As I just said in the introductory statement, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that low growth is the outcome of economies that need to have structural reforms, both in the product and the labour markets, but also in many other sectors, such as education and the judiciary. </p>
<p>However, having said that, we will certainly monitor any developments closely and let me say that we are fully aware of the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that a protracted period of low inflation does imply. </p>
<p>The level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is considerably lower, and that is one consideration to keep in mind. </p>
<p>We do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our decision at the last Governing Council meeting -- the monetary policy decision -- was, as I 've said, right. </p>
<p>That is why the asset quality review is so important, because it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually shorten this period of time. </p>
<p>The second point is that precisely that episode <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have injected an early repricing of assets, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually further protect the euro area from unwanted consequences. </p>
<p>But in terms of consequences, I can say that what the facts show is that there were limited spillovers in June, July -- May -- when, all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span>, it looked as if this tapering <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be happening sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>If we look at this from another angle, namely what all this does to the reference rate, I would say again that it is a matter for the Commission to elaborate a reference rate that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> stand against all these negative developments and come out stronger with respect to these things. </p>
<p>It takes time for the full effects to materialise and the amount of time it takes <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on many factors, in particular two. </p>
<p>And that is why we acted and that is why we -- as I said before -- are very aware of the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that a too low rate of inflation for a protracted period of time <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have and that is why we stand ready to act. </p>
<p>And therefore the long-term liquidity, three-year liquidity, was justified by that level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>When we conducted the LTROs two years ago, the level of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> was very high. </p>
<p>The two <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to compensate each other. </p>
<p>There is absolutely no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that it is much easier to adjust if you have inflation of 2% than if you have an inflation of 0% because of the rigidity of prices and wages, the downward rigidity of nominal prices and wages. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> certainly comment on that. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-01-09</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p>Right now we see limited upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and limited downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the inflation path. </p>
<p>There was this perverse angst -LRB- not perverted angst -RRB- that things were turning bad, but the opposite has happened: inflation is low and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> reduced ''. </p>
<p>On the first point, I 'm afraid there is a certain amount of <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>For example, the November migration figures show a significant increase in SEPA direct debits, to 26% of total transactions, more than double the October figures, when they had increased by 11.5%, and <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> four times the September figures, when it was only 7%. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> this modest recovery weaken all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span>? </p>
<p>Are the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation bigger in one direction or another? </p>
<p>I would be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about saying that, very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> indeed. </p>
<p>Even when we look at individual countries we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually see negative inflation rates in one or two countries, but then we should also ask how much of this is due to the necessary rebalancing of an economy that had lost competitiveness and had gone into a financial and budgetary crisis? </p>
<p>And then we asked ourselves: what is an unwanted tightening on the short money markets, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> then translate itself into a threat to the recovery? </p>
<p>On the second point, short-term money market rates <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on a variety of factors. </p>
<p>It certainly has reduced <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about interest rates -- the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of interest rates -- and also <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about monetary policy actions. </p>
<p>On the inflation side, as you say, this is our baseline scenario ; we do not see deflation right now, but, if we were to have low inflation for a very protracted period of time, it is quite clear that we should be extremely aware of the potential downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So, these <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> all, in a sense, undermine the success of this very modest recovery. </p>
<p>There are, as I said in the introductory statement and as unfortunately I have been saying now for months, downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the economic recovery, and the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> stem from all the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> -- financial and political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, commodity prices -- all the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> undermine the main factors driving the recovery: loss of confidence, even political crisis. </p>
<p>We asked ourselves questions more about what sort of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> undermine our baseline scenario. </p>
<p>I think that if you look at the drivers of this recovery, on the one hand we have export growth, and we think that global demand <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> continue to be what it is and, if anything, increase. </p>
<p>The third factor is that there is also <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> less of a fiscal drag than there was last year. </p>
<p>But we asked ourselves -- and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I have explained this on another occasion -- are we close to the Japanese scenario? </p>
<p>The banks are actually undertaking corrective action even before the AQR takes place, as you yourself <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>. </p>
<p>So, while it is true that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be short-term implications, you want to counterbalance them with all these considerations. </p>
<p>But there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that conditions in the financial markets have been gradually easing since July 2012. </p>
<p>On the first point: we have several instruments that we can use and our choice will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on what actually happens. </p>
<p>Regarding the weakness in lending and whether the AQR <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have increased this, one certainly <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have some short-term deleveraging by the banking system in order to be prepared for the AQR. </p>
<p>As usual, we discussed all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> instruments that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> cope with these two broad scenarios and our discussion will continue, is taking place as usual. </p>
<p>It is thus very, very difficult to draw the conclusion that there is a stable relationship between the two <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>. </p>
<p>And we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that current market developments are okay, but we think that there are two scenarios that would cause us to act: one is an unwarranted tightening of the short-term money markets, and the other one is a worsening of our medium-term outlook for inflation. </p>
<p>Now, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, of course, say this is related to technical market factors at the year-end, to a technical development, but you would see the same outcome and come to the same conclusion, if you undertake a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> broader comparison. </p>
<p>So, I think that it is pointless at this stage to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on which instrument we would use. </p>
<p>As I have said many times, it is also fragile, meaning that there are several <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- from financial and economic <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, through geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, to political <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> easily undermine this recovery. </p>
<p>Let us then move to 15 May 2013: excess liquidity was $ 303 billion, i.e. <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> the same amount as on 19 December 2011, but the EONIA was only 8 basis points. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-02-06</b>, 40 sentences</p></div><p>In other words, one-year forward interest rates have remained anchored, irrespective of what short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> looked like. </p>
<p>It focused on <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> policy action by the ECB, and concentrated specifically on what the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be and what <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> make the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, as we still see it, materialise. </p>
<p>When you look closely at what the term coordination implies, strict coordination <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> imply that one authority, one central bank takes a decision which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> not be what that authority would have taken if there were no coordination. </p>
<p>Because we said for the adverse scenario, the capital requirements <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be demanded immediately. </p>
<p>But we want to see exactly what the forthcoming information will <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> in terms of causes, perspectives and the length of this phenomenon, and any price projection, any inflation projection we make is obviously subject to the information and <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on the information we have up to that time, as is any action or decision we take. </p>
<p>Thus far, the euro area economy and euro area financial markets have shown a great deal of resilience with respect to these developments -- in a sense, far more resilience than was the case <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> a year ago, eight to nine months ago. </p>
<p>Regarding the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of the ECB purchasing such instruments, it was never discussed and I think it will never be discussed, let alone decided. </p>
<p>This result is partly due to the fact that short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in interest rates has not been transmitted to long-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of equal magnitude along the yield curve. </p>
<p>Yes, it is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>What instruments we decide to activate will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> we have to face. </p>
<p>So, let me say one more time that we are alert to this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and we stand ready and are willing to act. </p>
<p>The response to the second question is that we want to see clearly beyond the current <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>I just said that low inflation, these levels of inflation for a protracted period of time, are a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> on their own: are a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the recovery, are a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the weight of debt in real terms, and are a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p>On the first question, I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be wrong but I do not see, off hand, any relationship between the two programmes. </p>
<p>First, just a reminder that this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>, which is indeed in the information note that we published, is subject to several conditions. </p>
<p>So basically, we are watching, monitoring this <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>And the two <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> that I mentioned are really an unwanted tightening of the monetary policy that comes from the short-term markets and gets propagated to the long term and/or a worsening of the medium-term outlook for inflation. </p>
<p>But the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is occurring within a range that we have set ourselves, and it has not been transmitted thus far, at least not to the long term. </p>
<p>And some of it is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> due to the weakness of demand and the high levels of unemployment which are still much higher in the programme, and in the stressed countries, than they are in other parts of the euro area. </p>
<p>For the adverse scenario, which is a scenario that has some degree of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of happening but it is not a certainty that it will happen, these other types of hybrid are accepted. </p>
<p>But Mr Rajan is such a good economist and such an excellent central banker that he <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have very interesting ideas about this issue and I am looking forward to discussing them with him at the next G20. </p>
<p>OMT is a well-specified programme that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be activated if certain conditions are verified and it addresses <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> originate from redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>The second cause <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be weak demand and high unemployment. </p>
<p>As I have said many times, we have to be extremely <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> with this recovery, because it is still fragile, it is still uneven and it is really starting from low levels of activity. </p>
<p>The third reason is what we briefly touched upon before, which are the developments in the emerging market economies, and there the need is to look through this recent high <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in these economies, in all parameters of these economies, and see whether this is a temporary phenomenon or something that is going to stay with us for some time. </p>
<p>Finally, there is another piece of information which we do n't have yet and which is going to come out <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> next week, and that 's the GDP figure for the last quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>So this does n't mean that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception has disappeared ; <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception is there, but its effect on tightening is considerably less than it was before. </p>
<p>The second factor that led us to reflect is that when we look at monetary and credit developments by year end, which look subdued -- although they are stabilising, especially the credit flows -- we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, and we think we have evidence that, these figures are affected by banks ' behaviour in view of the asset quality review -LRB- AQR -RRB- performed by the ECB in the course of 2014, because the data upon which the AQR is going to be performed are data for year-end 2013. </p>
<p>A bank lending survey, amongst other things, assesses how credit standards change in time <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on different sorts of factors. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to forget that basically concealing the evidence of the banks ' balance sheets, preserving their opaqueness, does n't help lending -- it in fact hurts lending, so that is the other factor. </p>
<p>It is quite clear that, first, adjustment with low inflation is more difficult, and second, the very fact of having low inflation for a protracted period of time is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in itself. </p>
<p>I am not saying this to ignore the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of having low inflation for a protracted period of time. </p>
<p>But most, if not all, of the discussion was focused on examining the additional need for information and the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>Things <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> get better, but they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> stay as they are, or even get worse. </p>
<p>If you define by <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> or poor communication the fact that we do not announce cuts by the date and the time two or three years in advance, yes, our communication is poor: we do not do that. </p>
<p>In other words, the corporate bond issuance <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> compensates for the fall in credit flows in the last two months of the year. </p>
<p>So, one would not rule out a certain behaviour by the banks that would like to present their best data by the end of 2013, which means that this is going to affect credit flows, which means that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have different figures in the coming weeks about that. </p>
<p>One factor we look at is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception by the lenders, by the banks. </p>
<p>Our duty is to give the markets not what you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be hinting at: it is to give them the clearest explanation of what our reaction function is. </p>
<p>And the fairly interesting thing is that when we look at the effect of a certain <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception, we see that the effect of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception on bank lending in the euro area is by and large at the same level as it was in 2010, and even earlier, even at pre-crisis levels. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-03-06</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>But it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on so many things. </p>
<p>On the second point: well, you know it is always a matter of how you see the glass -- you asked me if I was disappointed by the credit developments: this is like the glass that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be seen as half empty or half full. </p>
<p>They <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> de-anchor themselves both upwards and downwards, but by and large, they have helped us to deliver, since the establishment of the ECB, our objective of an inflation rate that is below, but close to, 2%. </p>
<p>For example, the impact on the energy market, what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> this be for Europe? </p>
<p>If we look at a year and a half, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be very serious. </p>
<p>And a third <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be QE. </p>
<p>It is more and more clear that the situation of the emerging countries <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>, to a great extent, on the economic policies that have not been undertaken, or that have been undertaken in a wrong way, in the most vulnerable of these emerging market economies. </p>
<p>All in all, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the situation in the euro area is different and that there are other reasons that explain our low level of inflation. </p>
<p>And we asked ourselves whether the <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> I hinted at last time that would actually elicit monetary policy decisions, had taken place. </p>
<p>If we look back to the trough in the exchange rate in 2012 and then we look at the exchange rate today and we ask ourselves how much this has counted for the low inflation that we see today, we come up with a figure which is <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> 0.4 percentage points. </p>
<p>I think I will come back to this if I have questions on inflation, but that 's a significant statement on how the exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> influence our price stability objective. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember one of these <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> was an unwanted tightening of monetary policy on the short-term end of the market. </p>
<p>Also there are issues like the sovereign cap: ABS are rated according to their sovereign -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> with a few points difference, but this often does not make much sense. </p>
<p>So there are several issues and, in the end, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be the case that, to launch this market, one <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> need third party guarantees. </p>
<p>And third, international financial institutions like the IMF should, and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, create safety nets that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help some of these countries to cope with these spillovers. </p>
<p>Now, the lag of two years is actually questionable, because unfortunately the lag <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on how well the transmission channels of our monetary policy work. </p>
<p>No, we have not discussed scenarios of different impacts that the crisis <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have. </p>
<p>When we look at the specific situation in Ukraine, and if we look at it from a purely technocratic viewpoint, and we look at the amount of trade in goods, services and financial services and capital flows, we have to say that the interconnections are not as important as to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a strong contagion from that region. </p>
<p>Having said that, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are on the downside. </p>
<p>And so the only <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> path is to cure and proceed and carry out surgery if needed. </p>
<p>Whether the bad bank is the right instrument or not really <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the specific circumstances. </p>
<p>And on the backstop, we have always been very open: It <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a credit line from the ESM or it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be borrowing from the markets with joint government guarantees. </p>
<p>But bear in mind, as I said in the introductory statement, the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> of these projections increases with the length of the horizon. </p>
<p>One of the reasons, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the most important reason, for credit flows being low is the lack of demand. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on alternative sources of energy, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on how this crisis will evolve, and frankly, as I have said, we poor central bankers do not have enough information to give a reliable assessment of the economic impact at such an early stage in the crisis. </p>
<p>And the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, such as the decline in oil prices and unchanged exchange rates and many other <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, become more and more fragile as the horizon lengthens. </p>
<p>So the governance of this new institution should be such that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> decide in a matter of hours. </p>
<p>Having said that, we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>, because there was a previous depreciation of the euro. </p>
<p>The ECB view is that the mutualisation process should be sped up and the governance of this new institution should be effective so that the new institution, the resolution authority, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually take the swift decisions that are in its very nature because, as we all know, to resolve a bank is a decision that is often taken in hours. </p>
<p>The net injection of the liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> really only last for a relatively short time, less than a year. </p>
<p>Today, the capital charges for ABS discriminate ABS unfavourably with respect to other instruments with similar degrees of <span class='uncertainty'>riskiness</span>. </p>
<p>However, let me also add that this would be a limited way to look at the situation, because the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the area <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> quickly become substantial and generate developments that are unforeseeable and, potentially, of great consequence. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-04-03</b>, 34 sentences</p></div><p>On the second question, I can only reread the statement that has been agreed by the whole Governing Council:" The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of a too prolonged period of low inflation. '' </p>
<p>By the way, before, I mentioned that there were two reasons for this effect in March, for the 0.5%: one was the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of services prices around Easter time, and the second one was a base effect on energy. </p>
<p>In this context, the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> repercussions of both geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and exchange rate developments will be monitored closely ''. </p>
<p>I think you have rightly pointed to the key sentence in the statement:" The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments... '' -- meaning that we have n't finished with our conventional measures --"... also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of a too prolonged period of low inflation. '' </p>
<p>Also, one <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to consider -- and I think I made reference to this in the introductory statement -- the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> materialise into changes in energy prices as well. </p>
<p>In our case, all these effects go through the banks, so the final effect on the real economy <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span>, of course, on the demand for loans, but also on the state of health of the banking system. </p>
<p>On the first point, the too prolonged period of low inflation is, by itself -- and I think I have said this -- a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, because the longer the period of low inflation, the more likely the danger of inflationary expectations in the medium term becoming unanchored. </p>
<p>And on the other measure -- an untargeted LTRO -- frankly, what you are observing now on the excess liquidity front is that we have moved from $ 800 billion a year-and-a-half ago -- <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> two years, well, a year-and-a-half ago -- to about $ 100 billion. </p>
<p>So, it is quite important that fiscal consolidation is growth-friendly, as I have said many times, namely based on lower taxes, lower current government expenditure, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> if there is room, higher expenditure in infrastructure and structural reforms. </p>
<p>It has these two dimensions, both time and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>For example, an LTRO -- untargeted -- would address liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>The ECB has done, I think, what was <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>These are many instruments, each one of them will address a specific <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some profound changes are taking place in the world energy markets and you know which ones I am thinking about. </p>
<p>So this is both a definition related to the length of time -- the time horizon -- but it is also a definition that impinges on the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a lower inflation path than we have in our baseline scenario. </p>
<p>So we will continue our discussions, and important thing is that the Governing Council is unanimous, as I have said, in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments -- conventional, but also unconventional instruments -- within its mandate in order to cope effectively with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of a too prolonged period of low inflation. </p>
<p>This is something I have discussed several times when we say that low inflation rates do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on global factors: they do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on supply factors and relative price adjustments, but they also <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on a weakness of demand, where the existence of a wide output gap certainly plays a role. </p>
<p>There is also a <span class='uncertainty'>precautionary</span> consideration here. </p>
<p>On the other point, first and foremost, the longer the period of low inflation, the higher the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in terms of medium-term inflation expectations, which at the present time are firmly anchored and which, in our view of the medium term, represent the anchor towards which inflation will gradually pick up and will converge in the medium term. </p>
<p>We discussed the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of negative deposit rates, but our objective is maintaining price stability. </p>
<p>You want to have an inflation rate that is below, but close to 2% because -- and this is exactly what happened in Japan -- you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually think you have a non-zero positive inflation rate, while as a matter of fact you are already in a deflationary situation. </p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the Governing Council is looking at this prolonged period of low inflation and it is quite obvious that the longer the period of low inflation, the higher the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for inflation expectations in the medium and long term. </p>
<p>So you have a base effect which produced much lower inflation data in March and <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well produce higher inflation data next month. </p>
<p>The medium-term forward interest rates have been fairly well anchored and stable at the levels that we wanted, even though the period over the last three, four, five months has seen a substantial -- I would n't say <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> -- but certainly numerous actions by other jurisdictions, both on the monetary policy front and also, if you consider the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> that has characterised the emerging market economies, exchange rates and interest rates. </p>
<p>If you judge successful forward guidance by this measure -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I am biased observer, of course, but I think the Governing Council would agree with this and would <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to define the forward guidance as having been quite successful. </p>
<p>Even though we have to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about how to measure this. </p>
<p>In spite of that, frankly, we do not see the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation as having increased with respect to our assessment, which basically says that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are limited on both sides. </p>
<p>We do n't discuss policy measures for the effect they <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on the exchange rate ; that is going to be determined by the marketplace. </p>
<p>As I said, we do not see these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> now in the euro area. </p>
<p>One has to do with the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of services prices and the fact that Easter time this year comes remarkably later than last year. </p>
<p>The exchange rate is very important for price stability, so much so that we have made an explicit reference to it in the introductory statement, as you have seen, where we say that"... the Governing Council sees both upside and downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for price developments as limited and broadly balanced over the medium term. </p>
<p>In the course of our discussion, we talked about lower interest rates, we talked about a lower deposit facility rate, we talked about prolonging the fixed rate full allotment, we talked about QE -- so there was an ample and rich discussion, which is confirmed by the statement that I already read about the unanimity of the Governing Council and its commitment to fight <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for price stability. </p>
<p>There are many definitions of this and all of them are <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>And the second point on private debt is that it is not easy to design a programme of QE on private debt that is large in size and does n't have <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for financial stability. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-05-08</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>But now the question is, and the question that we have to look into is whether there are other factors besides energy and food that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> keep inflation low. </p>
<p>Well, some of these factors are the exchange rate and the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> weak domestic demand and weak employment figures. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span> the best way to respond to both questions is really to give a flavour of what sort of discussion we had today. </p>
<p>So, undermining the credibility of existing rules is never a good policy that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> generate growth, or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually be sort of a good justification for postponing structural reforms. </p>
<p>We have outflows also caused by a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> re-pricing of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in some other parts of the world following changes in monetary policies. </p>
<p>But what one can tell, is that it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much what is going to be the impact of the price of energy, the price of gas especially, and its implications on gas supplies to Europe for the coming year. </p>
<p>And the discussion was basically aiming at what sort of <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> would require action immediately or later on. </p>
<p>But there <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be, as the examples have shown, very little alternative. </p>
<p>And there are some downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> now, and the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have to do with the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> weakening of global demand, have to do with geo-political <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are of serious significance and have to do with the exchange rate. </p>
<p>On the first question, the too prolonged period of low inflation, you have a period like that when you see that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of de-anchoring medium-term inflation expectations are increasing. </p>
<p>And all these flows are, in a sense, trying other jurisdictions to see whether there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be a better combination of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and maturity. </p>
<p>There is also, as you know, capital controls are being gradually lifted, which also is a sign that confidence <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to have returned. </p>
<p>There have been developments over the last few weeks that have increased the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of the short-term, the very short-term money market rates and causing spikes in the rate. </p>
<p>So there 's no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that there are, sort of, quite sizeable flows now that are the main reason for this buoyant market. </p>
<p>That is certainly a unanimous conviction, and it 's also, I would say, reiterated in the introductory statement I read just a minute ago, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using also unconventional instruments within its mandate in order to cope effectively with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of a too prolonged period of low inflation. </p>
<p>Some national central banks have working groups also, watching closely what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the consequences, especially the central banks of the countries that are the main trading partners with Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Well, I do n't know whether it 's <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> or not. </p>
<p>And this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be due to either - or to both, either/or, either/and - the certainty by the markets that, if we were to see such transmissions, we would certainly act, being one of the <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> that I mentioned for action, and/or the certainty that these factors are temporary and they will wash away, as it has happened on several other occasions. </p>
<p>So people should be aware that if this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be seen as a threat to our independence, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> cause long-term damage to our credibility. </p>
<p>The geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> would certainly impact the euro zone if they were to increase and become more material and relevant than they are today. </p>
<p>To the second question, I would say that over the last few days we received plenty of advice from political figures, from institutions and, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> every day now, on interest rates, on exchange rates but also, on the other side of the scale, on the excess liquidity. </p>
<p>The first is that, in spite of the higher <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and to some extent the higher levels of the short term interest rate, this stayed within less than one week maturity. </p>
<p>I think I 've said several times that the longer is the period, the bigger are the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Some of these flows are caused by, in a sense, the geo-political <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that I was mentioning before. </p>
<p>So it 's a very complex geopolitical picture which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> evolve, and in a sense we 're only sure about one thing, that if it does evolve, the euro zone, the euro area and the European Union are going to be impacted more than other parts of the world. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-06-05</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>The other actor, very important actor, is the IMF, which is the only institution that can actually put in place a facility that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help emerging market economies to cope with transient but very significant spill-overs. </p>
<p>But what is changing and is in the process of changing is what I often say, the longer it lasts, the higher the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>And the growth-friendly way means lower current government expenditure, lower taxes, to the extent that it 's <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> within the stability and growth pact higher capital goods expenditure, higher public investment and all this should be accompanied by structural reforms. </p>
<p>We are reacting to a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a too-prolonged period of low inflation. </p>
<p>Of course, commercial banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> react to our decision by choosing to lower their rates if they think they should do so, and this would be then transmitted to savers. </p>
<p>And that does n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be conducive to growth. </p>
<p>First, the first half of the last three years, it was mostly the declines in the price of oil and food and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> some other commodities that have accounted for something like 75%, 80% of the difference between inflation then and inflation now. </p>
<p>The third point, or <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the first, is to acknowledge that diversity of views is an expression of democracy and therefore it is to be welcomed. </p>
<p>So it 's completely wrong to <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we want to expropriate savers. </p>
<p>I 'm really very grateful to all my colleagues in the Governing Council because being able to agree to have unanimity on such a complex set of instruments means a very, very extraordinary, <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> degree of consensus. </p>
<p>Because this will give you an idea of how long it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take to do this. </p>
<p>But attributable to this programme, it would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> take three or four quarters. </p>
<p>I 'm not saying that in the meantime the real economy <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> n't actually recover more. </p>
<p>However, this does n't exclude some little technical adjustments and which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> lead to some lower interest rates in one or the other or both parts of the corridor. </p>
<p>The main reason to commit to sterilisation, by my predecessor first and by myself later, was based on the effects, on the potential effects that this additional liquidity <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on inflation. </p>
<p>So this will say that interest rates will stay low for long, <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> longer than previously foreseen. </p>
<p>It 's quite a <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> sentence. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-07-03</b>, 34 sentences</p></div><p>With respect to the first question, you understand my reluctance to get into the actual intricacies of the case, but from our viewpoint, the viewpoint of a central bank, of a supervisor, the key thing is that the system is resilient to these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>On the capital relief, it very much will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the regulatory treatment and also on the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> retention, because we certainly want the intermediaries to retain some <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, because we learned painfully, I would say, from the crisis, how, all in all inadvisable it is not to have any <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> retention by the intermediaries. </p>
<p>This <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> help banks from two perspectives. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that the expectation for action itself injects a certain market behaviour, produces a certain market behaviour which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have nothing or very little to do with fundamentals. </p>
<p>So you have to have an interval of time that is such that the published account does n't actually create <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> with respect to the decisions that have been taken and does n't create <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> in the expectations about the decisions that will or <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be taken in the future. </p>
<p>We discussed this report last weekend in Basel, and I would say the following, which <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> is not going to surprise you, because it 's very much the same that other monetary policymakers in other jurisdictions have stated. </p>
<p>However, we are at the same time quite sensitive to the formation, creation, to the presence, of potential financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So we are addressing these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> as we see them, but the bottom line of this is that the first line of defence against financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> should be the macro-prudential exercise, macro-prudential tools. </p>
<p>The length of this period of time <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our medium-term outlook for inflation. </p>
<p>One of the reasons why securitisation actually got, rightly so, a bad name was that some of these products were so complicated that they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be priced correctly, and so that 's why transparency is going to be a key feature of this new concept. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Could</span> I exclude any technical adjustment in interest rates? </p>
<p>So it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become a self-fulfilling expectation with consequences on the markets. </p>
<p>And there, we 've taken a number of initiatives to address these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, from the asset quality review to the stress test to the recapitalisation of banks that are taking place now, as we speak, ahead of the results of the AQR. </p>
<p>In fact, as I said, interest rates will stay low for an extended period of time, and the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to use also nonstandard, unconventional measures to cope with the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a too-prolonged period of time of low inflation. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> discussed this on other occasions. </p>
<p>Banks can either participate individually, or they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> form a group if certain criteria are met. </p>
<p>It 's easier to have it if you have every six weeks, because it gives space for producing the account in a way that does n't disturb the expectations for further action and does n't in a sense <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the reception by the markets of the previous action that 's been taken. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> we should move to a six-month schedule rather than six-week schedule. </p>
<p>As far as the details of the TLTROs, let me say just a few things, and then for further questions, I will ask you to read the press statement, and also there will be a debriefing after the press conference by the staff of the ECB on all further questions you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> ask. </p>
<p>So the ECB and the ESCB and the supervisors in the SSM have been actively working -- and the ESRB, by the way -- have all been actively working to address this issue of financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> within a monetary policy stance that remains firmly geared to restore price stability. </p>
<p>Let me say also that we are enormously grateful to the national supervisors, without the work of which this effort <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be undertaken. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also add another thing, however, that when you add to bank credit flows, other sources of external financing by the companies -- namely, debt issuance on capital markets and equity issuance -- you see that the decline in bank lending has been compensated by equity and bond issuance. </p>
<p>By the way, there is already provisioning for legal <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, so the issue to see whether they 're adequate, and also, certainly, there will be attention to where these banks actually carry out their activities. </p>
<p>Are we ignoring the financial <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be produced because of the abundant liquidity, the very low <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> spreads, <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premiums, the very low spreads, the very narrow spreads? </p>
<p>In fact, you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> have noticed that also there is an improvement in the data showing a negative trend for growth but less negative than it was a month ago, two months ago, three months ago and so on. </p>
<p>So, on occasion, there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be disagreements, but all in all, the trend of this effort has to be judged positively. </p>
<p>As you 've seen <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> from the paper that we published together with the Bank of England, the outstanding amount of securitisations in the European Union at the end of 2013 was about $ 1.4 trillion, which is one-fifth of what 's in the US. </p>
<p>Now, using our internal analysis, our internal models, we have asked the question whether this new measure, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on its take-up, will have an impact on the inflation rate and the growth rate of the euro area. </p>
<p>On the TLTRO, actually, first of all, we mentioned the figure last time of 7% of the loan book of banks amounting <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> to $ 400billion, and the overall take-up <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> reach a maximum of $ 1 trillion, so that is what 's available for the banks. </p>
<p>In this case, there would be also the interest in promoting securitisation that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually help, as I said before, lending to the real economy and to the SMEs. </p>
<p>The purpose of this programme is to address the impairment in the bank lending channel, to address fragmentation, which translates itself into different funding access conditions and different <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premiums across the euro areas, countries, members. </p>
<p>Of course, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the take-up, it will be very helpful in taking the inflation rate back to below but close to 2% over the horizon that we have discussed on other occasions. </p>
<p>So, certainly, attention will be devoted to adequate provisioning for these legal <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So to some extent, the size of the market is endogenous, and it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on certain conditions, one of which is regulation. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-08-07</b>, 39 sentences</p></div><p>We 're still assessing what <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> likely impact sanctions <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on the euro area economy. </p>
<p>Oh, on this point, let me just make a point, which was a source of some <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>The differences in prices that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> arise from the transfers would have to be filled by the banking sector, not by the government. </p>
<p>The resolution fund owns this bank and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span>, and hopefully soon, will sell it back. </p>
<p>Now, of course, these are the initial decisions.There 's still a lot of work to do about that, in terms especially of transferring the assets between the two entities and the prices at which they 'll be transferred, the treatment of the <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> in Angola. </p>
<p>And we certainly would not and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not recreate that sort of market, because it was considered -- some of these imperfections were actually considered one of the major roots or the major causes of the financial crisis. </p>
<p>We see <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> especially coming from the price of energy. </p>
<p>And certainly the aim of the ECB, the objective of the ECB and the way price stability has been interpreted by the Governing Council of the ECB all throughout its existence, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all throughout its existence, is that inflation should go at below but close to 2%, and we are far from that objective. </p>
<p>And real means that they are not going to be a sausage full of derivatives, as said in a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more popular language. </p>
<p>On the first point, let me say that the assessment of the present situation is especially <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> because, especially over the last 2-3 months, we 've had some positive signs. </p>
<p>So our <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the recovery were on the downside to begin with, and certainly one of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> would be geopolitical developments. </p>
<p>And the other news is that we are about to hire -- I ca n't disclose any names, because the thing is n't finished yet -- but we are about to hire a consultant who will help us to design this programme in the best <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> fashion. </p>
<p>I said that the ABS final action will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the action of many other actors. </p>
<p>You 're right in saying that the weak GDP figure <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> also on technical factors, like the lower number of working days in the period that 's being observed. </p>
<p>I would only add that we are proceedings with our work regardless of what the timing is for <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> regulatory changes in this area. </p>
<p>For the other countries, the countries that now are having deflation, the key question -- there 's no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that this sort of negative growth in prices <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the lack of demand, but also on relative price adjustment. </p>
<p>Second, this market can actually -- we do -- I mean, Bank of England and ourselves <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that this market can restart, but the economics of this market must work. </p>
<p>And this is a much longer process that does n't have to do necessarily much with expectations and self-fulfilling expectations, but it takes -- it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take a long time, because it takes changes -- it takes movements of factors, people from one sector to another, and we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well observe this phenomenon in the so-called deflation countries. </p>
<p>Now, market estimates and indications by individual banks would <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to say that, overall -- so not only in the first two tranches, but also in the periodic operations -- a take-up between $ 450 billion and $ 850 billion should materialise. </p>
<p>Well, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that if you look at the world today, you see the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have increased all over the world. </p>
<p>The second question related to geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>But having said that, there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that inflation is low and will remain low. </p>
<p>Now, we 'll <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> make further progress in creating what the new President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called a ` capital markets union '. </p>
<p>And I see this as a likely <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> in the future. </p>
<p>But it 's quite clear that if the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> materialize, it 's quite clear that the next two quarters will show lower growth. </p>
<p>So lower taxes, lower current expenditure, and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> higher government investment, government investment expenditure, public investment expenditure. </p>
<p>So geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are heightened, are higher than they were a few months ago. </p>
<p>But all this is <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> only if the better conditions are complemented by structural reforms. </p>
<p>And this <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on factors that were, in a sense, in the baseline, like a slowing net trade surplus, but also <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on factors like there has been a decline in short-term capital inflows. </p>
<p>And that 's where I said several times that it 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> high time now to start sharing sovereignty in that area as well, taking the structural reforms area in the marketplace, product reforms, Single Market legislation, implementation and labour market reforms, under common union discipline -- in other words, trying to replicate our success in the budgetary area also in the structural reforms. </p>
<p>Also, when again we examine the reasons for the tight supply, we see -- and I think this has been going on now for three or four months -- we see that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perception, or <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion, has lost importance as a factor, reducing supply or increasing tightness. </p>
<p>It has grown in having more instruments, in becoming more adequate to respond to the <span class='uncertainty'>varying</span> needs of a difficult economic situation. </p>
<p>But the second answer has to do with the reforms, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, the general <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> the lack of structural reforms produces a very powerful factor that discourages investment. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on what we define by QE. </p>
<p>Other central banks have been reducing their <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to the euro. </p>
<p>Well, the asset quality review includes all portfolios, and that includes also, of course, the <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> and securities that one bank <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have on other banks and those assets are then subject to the exam to see if they are properly valued in the balance sheet of the banks. </p>
<p>The market reaction both in Portugal and out of Portugal basically confirmed this view, this view that authorities have been swift and effective, and what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have been a systemic incident is actually now considered an incident, an episode which is restricted to this bank and to the owners of this bank. </p>
<p>Both they and the European -LSB- Commission 's -RSB- competition arm worked very well together and basically addressed a situation which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be potentially complex. </p>
<p>Also, let me add that the indications coming from the bank lending survey that, as I just said, show a gradual -- show actually I think for the first time a pickup in demand for loans and a gradual lessening of tightness on the supply side, would <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to indicate that these TLTROs will actually happen at the right time when there is demand for them. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-09-04</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>Reducing taxes that are especially distortionary, where the short-term multipliers <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be higher, and cutting expenditure in the most unproductive parts, so mostly, actually not mostly, entirely, current government expenditure. </p>
<p>The usual <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> are behind this. </p>
<p>So in this sense the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we want to react to now do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on factors that are not exogenous to the euro area economy. </p>
<p>And so we decided to go ahead, but certainly, some of these changes will be needed to rebuild a market which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be, especially in Europe, an important channel of credit intermediation. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go on with the tendering procedure if you are interested. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be good securitisation, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on what people trade, how much <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> they retain and so on, and that 's what we and the Bank of England are aiming at, rebuilding this market, but for doing that, we need not only the presence of the central banks, but also the regulatory changes that would be justified. </p>
<p>But of late, the forecast errors still <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on food and energy errors, but also <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on other factors. </p>
<p>So there are <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>. </p>
<p>Well, it 's a convention, a standard monetary policy decision, and one expects effects according to the usual line of thinking, but in this case it clearly signals to the banks that are going to participate in the TLTRO that they should not expect any further lowering in interest rate, so they should not hesitate to participate in the TLTRO because of this reason, because they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> wait for a lower interest rate in the future. </p>
<p>As I 've said several times, the longer the period of low inflation the higher the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of de-anchoring. </p>
<p>So by and large, these are the underlying <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span>, and in some cases, I do think they also foresee an increase in the price of food. </p>
<p>We 've said this on all <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> occasions, because it 's true. </p>
<p>I do n't see exactly the opposition but it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be here and there, but prima facie the two things <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to go together. </p>
<p>Within the Stability and Growth Pact, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do things that are growth-friendly and also would contribute to budget consolidation, and I gave an example of a balanced budget tax cut. </p>
<p>The downward trend that we are witnessing this year is viewed as a temporary <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> from a baseline which will see inflation expectations going back toward 2%, but not at 2%, in 2016. </p>
<p>The sellers <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well not be banks only by the way ; they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be also institutional investors. </p>
<p>I 'm saying especially in Europe, because of course we are completely focused on the bank lending channel, and this would on the one hand be sidelining the traditional credit channel, but on the other, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go back to what it was before the crisis. </p>
<p>There is an <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> contradiction here, but in facts it 's not the case. </p>
<p>And to the second question: no there is n't such a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, because we announced about the interest rates that they would be for all practical purposes at the lower bound, but technical adjustments <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, and that 's what we did. </p>
<p>Let me also add one thing, because the ABS <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> sound more, I would say novel, than they are in the ECB policy-making, and indeed, the modality is novel, because we would do outright purchases of ABS, but the ABS have been given as collateral for borrowing from the ECB for at least ten years, so the ECB knows very well how to price and how to treat the ABS that 's accepted, especially since we have, - and this is in a sense another dimension that makes any precise quantification difficult at this point in time - we have narrowly defined our outright purchase programme to simple and transparent ABS. </p>
<p>In this sense, the ABS outright purchases <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be viewed as a measure that strengthens the TLTRO. </p>
<p>It 's also true that in the years previous to the entrance -- in the last four or five years, there have been signs of <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> in prices and in economic policy. </p>
<p>The creation of the ECB and the euro gave a framework where all these countries <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually share sovereignty in crafting the monetary policy of the euro area. </p>
<p>So we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be more precise especially once the TLTROs, at least the first two TLTROs, have taken place. </p>
<p>But we 've seen the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> increasing of late, and that explains why we have decided to strengthen the measures decided in June and complement these measures with others. </p>
<p>On the scale of the dissent, I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that there was a comfortable majority in favour of doing the programme, and now on the content of the discussion, I 've given some hints before. </p>
<p>Previous to having the euro, many central banks, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> all of them with the exception of one, had lost completely national sovereignty. </p>
<p>But the answer to this question is: would the truth be a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>? </p>
<p>We are unanimous in the intent, but when the time comes to decide exactly what measures we should undertake there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be differences of view. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> my definition is unduly limiting the movement that we had. </p>
<p>And this would have several, in my view, benefits: first of all a political process that is <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> easier than it would be if only at national level. </p>
<p>I think one can construct many examples of why this sharing of sovereignty <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> improve the prospects. </p>
<p>And now we are at the lower bound, where technical adjustments are not going to be <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> any longer. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-10-02</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>But our monetary policy has strongly supported the economy with a reduction of the strong <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which characterised the euro area as a whole, and Italy in particular, linked as it was to the euro and the crisis of sovereign debt of 2011-2013. </p>
<p>Therefore, the great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that affected financial markets in the past has virtually disappeared. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> disappeared on the financial markets, not in the world of the real economy, and that 's where we need to make steps forward. </p>
<p>More recently we see that the forecast error that 's been made in forecasting inflation can not be attributed only to the <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> on oil prices, food prices and the exchange rate. </p>
<p>It improved the financial conditions of banks, so as to make it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> for banks to loan money to the real economy. </p>
<p>Monetary policy has been clearly as easy as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> and will continue to be until the objectives are reached. </p>
<p>The financial system <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to be on the verge of collapse. </p>
<p>But certainly, having said that, I just said how closely we are watching inflation and inflation expectations in the medium term, and I can only reiterate that the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using other unconventional instruments if it were to judge that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of too low inflation for too prolonged a time were to deteriorate. </p>
<p>First of all, all the details, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all the details of the programme, will come out in the press release at 3.30 p.m. Let me say, it 's hard to assess a figure, to give a figure on this programme as such, because there are several interactions between the ABS programme, the covered bond programme and the TLTRO programme. </p>
<p>In this part of the world, things are not going well because you have pervasive unemployment and you have very low, weak economic activity, and in some countries with a recession that <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to never end, so you ca n't expect people being enthusiastic about that. </p>
<p>The third point is that we want to be as inclusive as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>The countries that need to consolidate their public finances would have to do it anyway, and one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even argue that some forms of fiscal consolidation, some forms of structural reforms, would even be more difficult and more costly outside, but this has been a counterfactual. </p>
<p>The first is that there is a series of measures that mitigate <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the specific purchases that are to happen there, so that the assets bought there would be risk-equivalent to assets bought elsewhere, so for example, size-wise, type-wise. </p>
<p>But basically, we 've been accepting ABS in our collateral for ten years, so it was quite natural to have as much similarity as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> with our collateral rules when we come to <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> assessment. </p>
<p>I would say that the measures we 've taken have been determined exactly because our medium-term outlook on inflation expectation has worsened and we see that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have increased. </p>
<p>There is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that these measures, like the TLTROs and the ABS and the covered bond programme, will unfold over a certain horizon, and we have done a lot of things since June. </p>
<p>That makes life <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> easier, but I have to say that I would n't want to emphasise the balance sheet size per se. </p>
<p>I think that 's the ultimate yardstick by which we will measure the success of the present measures and any other measures that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> take in the future. </p>
<p>We know that our measures are going to be more effective, or <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> are effective only if other policies will be in place. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-11-06</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> so. </p>
<p>Third, we <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to forget that all three countries, US, UK and Japan, had fiscal deficits which were several times what the fiscal deficit is in Europe. </p>
<p>So the lessons from other countries and other jurisdictions are very important in the sense that they make us think about how to make the most of the measures we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be taking if needed. </p>
<p>The two <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> are: -LSB- 1 -RSB- are the measures to be taken going to produce the effects? </p>
<p>Subsequent events, the extraordinary performance of Ireland -- next year Ireland will be the fastest-growing economy in Europe, in the euro area certainly -- <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to say that after all, that decision was n't that stupid. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that if it 's not monetary financing, it 's in our mandate. </p>
<p>The third, which is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most important, is to give information to the markets on how to better interpret our monetary policy decisions. </p>
<p>Because <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on its composition, each injection of liquidity will have a different effect, as we 've seen in other experiments, and it does matter. </p>
<p>Actually we <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to forget that it is size and composition. </p>
<p>When we <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> in our views and in our policies -LRB- it 's another obsession of some of you -RRB- there is no drawing line between north and south. </p>
<p>Our balance sheet will continue to expand under all universes, either under the measures that we have already taken, and/or under measures that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to take if needed. </p>
<p>But -LSB- 2 -RSB- the outlook <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> worsen. </p>
<p>More seriously, we know the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are to the downside, and we know we have to be prepared. </p>
<p>The first <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> is that our current measures are not enough. </p>
<p>We should be aware that the effects of QE are different <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the initial conditions. </p>
<p>Well, actually someone said it was one of the best discussions we ever had, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the best discussion we ever had, because we discussed the public accounts. </p>
<p>And in fact, we 'll now try to see which central banks are going to be ready, in how long a time, and adapt the framework that we have today, which has been geared and prepared only for outside managers, to include national central banks that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be ready and willing to do it. </p>
<p>Well, there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be two <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> push us to do more, and that 's what the paragraph that I 've just read implies. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have given the wrong impression. </p>
<p>There are two <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> we look at. </p>
<p>First of all -LRB- these are numbers that I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have given you in the past -RRB-: the default rate for all structured finance in Europe between 2007 and 2013 was 1.5%, compared with 18.4% in the United States, because the United States obviously had the sub-prime. </p>
<p>Its with enormous satisfaction that today I can read to these people that there is a Fitch ratings document the title of which says ` ECB takes minimal credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> with ABS ', and it considers the criteria to be conservative. </p>
<p>The second <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> is if our medium-term outlook for inflation expectations were to worsen. </p>
<p>There is <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing, It 's normal. </p>
<p>I do n't know what the others <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say. </p>
<p>The second question was on <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing in the ABS programme? </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2014-12-04</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p>We 've discussed, amply, monetary policy measures and today we have discussed the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of doing QE where the central bank would buy government bonds as one option, but also other types of bonds and other types of assets. </p>
<p>But what I can say is that it 's 1.4%, so it 's lower than previously <span class='uncertainty'>predicted</span>. </p>
<p>I think it 's pointless to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> what sort of majority will actually happen to be in place at the time when we will decide, if we decide, if we were to decide these measures. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on how our assessment will go. </p>
<p>Normally in ordinary time, which is monetary policy, it 's not addressing the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of a certain situation, so this is pure monetary policy. </p>
<p>So we 'll <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the monetary policy stimulus achieved, the expansion of the balance sheet and the outlook for price developments. </p>
<p>There is a lot to look at and to <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span>, and to look at the medium-term outlook for inflation. </p>
<p>Incidentally, there has been a rumour that the conditions of the second TLTRO <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> change. </p>
<p>So you see that that has had an effect on the duration of their <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span>. </p>
<p>That is very important to keep in mind because it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> alter the profile of inflation rates over the coming months, especially in the next few months. </p>
<p>It had significant financing easing effects, and one of the effects we often forget is that in spite of the fact that the net take-up was not remarkable, it did change significantly the average maturity of the banks ' <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to the ECB, because they basically substitute their present <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span>, short-term maturity of three months, with the longer-term TLTRO, and now the average <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> is just less than a year. </p>
<p>So there is enough evidence to say that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be effective. </p>
<p>Should it become necessary to further address <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate, and that 's exactly where the work that 's being done by the ECB staff and by the relevant committees comes in very, very useful, because it 's opened up a very rich, ample discussion on different unconventional instruments. </p>
<p>Now, let me make absolutely clear that we wo n't tolerate prolonged <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from price stability, and the main reason is that if these <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> feed into inflation expectations, they 'll cause a drop on medium to long-term inflation expectations, which by the way still are within a range consistent with medium-term price stability. </p>
<p>But then you have a third effect, which <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> happen if the lower prices get embedded in a lower wages formation process. </p>
<p>So the transmission channels <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be several, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> also on the sort of QE we design, and keeping in mind that we have already decided important measures, like the ABS programme and the covered bonds programme, that are and will be especially producing effects over an extended period of time. </p>
<p>So much so that in normal times we would address this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> by lowering nominal interest rates. </p>
<p>The portfolio rebalancing effect, namely if you buy euro-denominated assets, people who will get cash, will buy <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> non-euro-denominated assets, and you have a portfolio rebalancing effect through that channel. </p>
<p>It can be designed, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, it can be designed to have a consensus. </p>
<p>All these decisions do have an effect, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a credit-easing effect, or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a signalling effect, or <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a portfolio rebalancing effect. </p>
<p>As I said before, it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> fall further because of oil prices. </p>
<p>I 'm still confident, but we have to remember that we have a mandate, and as I said before, we do n't tolerate <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from our mandate that would cause ultimately a tightening, an unwanted tightening of our monetary policy. </p>
<p>It says in this context, early next year, the Governing Council will <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the monetary stimulus achieved, because we do n't want an unwanted tightening of our monetary policy stance due to a decrease in medium-term inflation expectations. </p>
<p>OMT was addressing the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the euro coming from redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> and it was necessary to address this confidence crisis in a way that the action of the ECB would be deemed credible by the markets, which was the case. </p>
<p>We judge the success of a programme, and especially this programme, <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the contribution that it 's giving to overcoming the impairment of some credit markets. </p>
<p>The policies that we are discussing today address the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of low inflation for too long a time such that it would feed into lower medium-term inflation expectations. </p>
<p>On the second question, we discussed several options and at some point someone advanced this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>, not on this occasion, on another occasion. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually be of great help for the implementation of the investment plan. </p>
<p>You all see this point, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>Evidently we are convinced that a QE programme which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> include sovereign bonds falls within our mandate, or better, is an eligible instrument that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> use in the pursuit of our mandate. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-01-22</b>, 30 sentences</p></div><p>It <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on many parameters, and at this point, certainly we would n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on precise deadlines. </p>
<p>So we 're very alert to that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>What you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> look at is basically the past behaviour as an inference for the future behaviour of our purchases. </p>
<p>And the sentence and the wording here <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be, actually says many things. </p>
<p>So it 's different readings of reality, which <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a different urgency in acting. </p>
<p>The Luxemburg central bank was indemnified for Icelandic banks when, you 'll remember there was that crisis, on a full risk-sharing, and we raised the buffers on a full risk-sharing for some potential losses that Germany, the Bundesbank, <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have after the Lehman crisis. </p>
<p>As I just said, it would be a big mistake if countries were to consider that the presence of this programme <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be an incentive to fiscal expansion. </p>
<p>Third, there was a good discussion on the need, I would say a majority on the need to trigger it now, but of course there were <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views about the need to act now. </p>
<p>On the second question, we would <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the measures taken today will be effective, will raise inflation, medium-term inflation expectations, and basically will address the economic situation in the euro area. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have some effects, but they are not relevant. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> and are convinced and have good arguments to think that the monetary policy measures that we have decided today will contribute to lift inflation expectations. </p>
<p>The second question, well, I would say the readings of reality <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span>. </p>
<p>On the first question, we monitor closely any potential instance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to financial stability. </p>
<p>We should n't forget that -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> today is the first time I say it, usually by now I am in the fifth time -- We should n't forget that our mandate is price stability, price stability defined as keeping inflation rate close but below 2%. </p>
<p>In that case, risk-sharing is fundamental for the effectiveness of monetary policy, and by the way, to address these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, OMT is there, ready to be acted, in case there were <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of that kind, of that nature, tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were to materialise, and that programme is under full risk-sharing. </p>
<p>Originally, in the early times, there were two lists of collateral, one risk-shared, the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of which was shared, the so-called Tier 1, and one where the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> was not shared, and that 's Tier 2. </p>
<p>And then there is this 33% issuer limit, which means that, if all the other conditions are in place, we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> buy bonds in, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, July, because by then there will be some large redemptions of SMP bonds and therefore we would be within the limit. </p>
<p>In OMT full risk-sharing is fundamental for the effectiveness of that monetary policy measure and you understand why ; because it 's selective, it addresses specific countries, the countries are under stress, the debt sustainability is an issue and there are tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make things precipitate for certain individual countries. </p>
<p>I have some jokes that I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> make at this point in time, but I 'll just re-read the statement if you want, because that 's really what we can say today, and I 'd just rather avoid jokes on this. </p>
<p>The other question, first of all let me say I was surprised that this risk-sharing issue became <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> the most important thing about our monetary policy decisions today. </p>
<p>So there is little <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>, in our view at least, that one should act. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be some local episodes of certain specific markets where prices are going up fast. </p>
<p>In these three years we 've lowered interest rates I do n't know how many times, four or five times, six times <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span>. </p>
<p>So the question on how to allocate <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the euro area has been with the Governing Council since the very beginning. </p>
<p>I just do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>, giving horizons of dates, of deadlines. </p>
<p>On one hand you want to keep the principle of full <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing in place. </p>
<p>And finally, given the size that this programme will have and the fact it 's so broad-based all across all countries, the solution that we found <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to be the most reasonable. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> as well have asked, what is sustained adjustment? </p>
<p>I have told you that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing or no <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing was not a fundamental aspect of the effect, of the effectiveness of our monetary policy measures today, while it is a fundamental component of our OMT programme. </p>
<p>The consensus means the following, means that everybody <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> either agree or not object. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-03-05</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>You remember, when we discussed the effects of lower oil prices a few months ago, we said they were a good thing, but also there was a potential negative side to that if these effects produced second round effects which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a deflationary impact. </p>
<p>Our monetary policy decisions have significantly decreased the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of second round effects coming from lower oil prices on inflation. </p>
<p>And here the channel through which this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> happen is the following. </p>
<p>Then market access <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be restored. </p>
<p>That 's the most important thing that we can do today, to preserve the solvency and the robustness of the Greek banking system, and also to this extent, the ECB has asked the Eurogroup members to make sure that the recapitalisation fund of something around $ 10 billion be readily available to face any <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> negative <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> materialise. </p>
<p>And this is important, and I 'm saying this because if there is in place a certain communication that creates <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the markets, this communication destroys collateral, increases the spreads and destroys collateral, undermines the solvency of the Greek banking system. </p>
<p>I do n't want to comment on the ill feelings, but certainly, what I would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> is you go back to the last 15-plus years and look at which countries have been in the excessive deficit procedure most often, over the last, say, 15, 16, 17 years, and then draw a conclusion from there. </p>
<p>Now you asked the question to what extent our decisions <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on what happens in the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our monetary policy decisions have avoided this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>As soon as Greece repays the SMP bonds that are due, they 're coming due I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in July or August, and if the waiver had been reinstated of course, then we would be able to buy Greek bonds via this new asset purchase programme. </p>
<p>First of all, once a country has a contract, then disbursements <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take place, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be restored by the member states. </p>
<p>ELA is a decision of the National Central Bank of Greece, to which the Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> decide to object with a very special and demanding majority requirement, if certain conditions are not in place. </p>
<p>That is, otherwise we can provide as much credit as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Having said that, we stand ready to reinstate the waiver as soon as we are able to make a positive assessment about the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of a successful completion of the review. </p>
<p>And the conditions to be in place is that a process which <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> a successful completion of the review be put in place fast. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, we expect, we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that the obstacle that exists for the completion of the fifth review, the law on foreclosures, the obstacle that exists will be lifted and we will be able to participate in the QE programme. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not be any waiver or exception to that. </p>
<p>We observe that <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> half of the euro bonds are outside the euro area and we also observe that the average weighted price of bonds in the 2 to 30-year maturity is well above par. </p>
<p>But the bottom line of this is that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be complexities. </p>
<p>The second question <span class='uncertainty'>assumes</span> that the improvements we see in the financial markets will never pass through to the real economy, but that 's exactly what we have not been observing over the last few months. </p>
<p>Monetary financing is when the central bank of a country prints money to buy the government bonds in the primary market of that country, and it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be either direct or indirect, when banks bring collateral to the ECB in order to be financed in order to buy the sovereign debt of that country, and we are prohibited from doing that. </p>
<p>It 's quite interesting that until a month ago, nobody had any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that public debt, sovereign debt in the euro area, was actually very, very big, and now some people worry that we wo n't have enough bonds. </p>
<p>What I <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say, however, is that the monetary policy measures that we decided in January, but also for the previous ones, to be fully effective, need first and foremost strong structural reforms. </p>
<p>Let me first say something that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> is not entirely known. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-04-15</b>, 36 sentences</p></div><p>From a regulatory perspective, it should n't change, unless I 'm mistaken, but by and large, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that these worries are, to say the least, premature, certainly not supported by the current evidence. </p>
<p>Certainly, as you <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span>, you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to say, further action is needed on strengthening active labour-market policies. </p>
<p>But the argument which we hear often is that structural reforms in the long run <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> produce some positive effect on output growth ; in the short run they actually do n't. </p>
<p>There has to be looking through <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> outcomes in measured inflation in either direction if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>On Spain, it 's I think beyond question, the fact that the Spanish economy is experiencing a strong and an employment-rich recovery, and <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> half a million jobs have been created since the end of 2013. </p>
<p>Also, when we look at the composition of these answers, we see that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion factor, which used to be a stronger limit to credit expansion, has lost a lot of its weight, if not all. </p>
<p>So that 's why there should n't be any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about doing structural reforms. </p>
<p>I 'm quite surprised, frankly, by the attention that a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> early exit of the programme receives, when we 've been in this programme only a month, and like a colleague of ours said today, during the discussion in the Governing Council, he said, you know, he has run several marathons, it 's like asking yourself, after 1 km, are we going to finish this marathon? </p>
<p>One of the reasons why this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be entirely correct is that good sound structural reforms actually raise expected permanent income, expected permanent income and therefore have an effect immediately on consumption for firms for households and on investments for firms. </p>
<p>It 's entirely <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the conditions that will be in place, that are in place, and clearly, the answer to all these questions about ELA and further prosecution of ELA is entirely in the hands of the Greek government and the negotiations that are taking place between the Greek government and euro area members. </p>
<p>Well, I 'll quickly and readily answer the second question immediately, saying that I do n't even want to contemplate that, and based on the Greek government leaders ' statements, this option is not contemplated by themselves as well, so I 'm not ready to discuss any <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> situation like that. </p>
<p>There are certain conditions that would lead people to think there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be a bubble that we have seen before the crisis started, one of which is a serious, significant increase in leverage. </p>
<p>When I hear that the level of interest rates <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be an incentive or a disincentive for countries governments to change their labour markets, I ask myself, should n't the unemployment level be an incentive to change the labour market, especially since these levels are not the output, or not only the output of the financial crisis. </p>
<p>And especially now, that we 've <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to enter into a period of time where economic conditions are improving. </p>
<p>To the extent that these imbalances are <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> localised, that 's the answer. </p>
<p>So far, we have reached an <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to Greece of $ 110 billion, which is the highest in the euro area in relation to GDP. </p>
<p>One of which is certainly the condition of the capital stock in the euro area where many, many years of low investment both private and public would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that the years ahead should see a firming up of investments. </p>
<p>We would have to see, what sort of scarcity, where, who 's actually scarce of these bonds, but so far, frankly, we do n't have any evidence that this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> happen in the future, but it 's always good to ask difficult questions. </p>
<p>Now to the first point, if I correctly remember our discussion it was not so much about certainty or <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> of the recovery after 2016, but it was about the cyclical nature of the recovery as it is today. </p>
<p>That this recovery is <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> upon the full implementation of our monetary policy stance, so let 's never forget that. </p>
<p>Now the situation <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be different. </p>
<p>It 's quite clear that our monetary policy stance avoided that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, and it eased the pass-through of lower oil prices into higher consumption and in due time higher investment. </p>
<p>So I think the discussion was not so much about, certainly oil certainly, but about what the conditions need to be in place after say 2016 <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> in 2017 that would guarantee that the present cyclical recovery becomes a potential output growth recovery. </p>
<p>Well it 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most difficult question I got today. </p>
<p>But there is one thing one reassuring thing that I <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that all these people who are actually part and parcel of these big decisions are responsible people, so I take for granted that they will not cause a banking crisis. </p>
<p>You remember when we experienced this dramatic fall in oil prices there were many worries that there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> not be all that pass-through into higher spending but actually the opposite <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> take place having negative second round effects on lower inflation. </p>
<p>It 's not obvious, and that is one of the things that look more and more <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> in the analysis, it 's not obvious what is the pass-through between changes in the exchange rate and the inflation rate. </p>
<p>There is another factor which would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that the pressure to de-lever should gradually ease if it 's not eased already. </p>
<p>We view the current developments, the current and recent developments of the exchange rate, as the outcome of different monetary policy cycles in different jurisdictions, and the monetary policy cycles in turn <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the different business cycles in the different jurisdictions. </p>
<p>I think if we are to run the same survey now we would <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> find a better number. </p>
<p>This will give you good hints of what <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come out ; it 's going to be mostly a qualitative process and based on several indicators. </p>
<p>We 've seen that in the past and we are aware that this is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>As I said the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are still there, but they are diminished. </p>
<p>You <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember when last year in December, I did mention the fact that in a zero lower-bound situation, where nominal interest rates are at lower bound, what determines real rates are movements in inflation expectations. </p>
<p>As I said, it 's very, very early to say anything like that, but also, let me give you an idea of what <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come out in a certain amount of time from now. </p>
<p>Of course, there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and I 've dwelt on that but if you have any question I 'll be glad to take up. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-06-03</b>, 27 sentences</p></div><p>The lessons that one draws from the crisis <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on what one views as the main factors, the main reasons for a crisis. </p>
<p>But the more general issue is really, I think, we should focus now at this <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> in finding a strong agreement. </p>
<p>We do n't know where the next crisis will come from, but at least we ought to be reasonably confident that we 've done everything we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> to make our financial services industry more robust, stronger and more resilient. </p>
<p>And so if you compare the latest data of the last part of last year with the data that we will have at the end of this year, under the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that we would have no further declines, you have a base effect. </p>
<p>And that would n't <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a redesign of the OMT programme, although it has other interesting suggestions for other functions that the ECB is currently performing. </p>
<p>Again, I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on this. </p>
<p>So these rules are being applied and they are being regularly <span class='uncertainty'>reassessed</span> as developments in the financial markets unfold. </p>
<p>But there is n't any real financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we can see in that market or elsewhere. </p>
<p>And a strong agreement is one that produces growth, that has social fairness, but that is also fiscally sustainable and addresses the remaining sources or factors of financial <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> in the financial sector. </p>
<p>Things that are unsustainable in a certain situation, because the policies that are being undertaken are wrong, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become sustainable. </p>
<p>And economies that are not viable under a certain set of policies <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become viable under a different set. </p>
<p>I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of these events. </p>
<p>And we do n't see, so far, the emergence of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, even in one of the sectors that is most often quoted, like the housing market. </p>
<p>On your first question, the answer is no, because basically, and this also holds for all the other <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> questions on this issue, negotiations are proceeding at this point in time, so there is no point in me commenting on different aspects of these negotiations and different proposals. </p>
<p>We see selected local situations where one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually think that price movements are wide. </p>
<p>The answer is that when we see a financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, this should be addressed by the proper instruments, which are macroprudential instruments. </p>
<p>What I said before is that, if need be, if there were other factors which would, for example, create an unwanted tightening of monetary policy or, when we discuss growth, we said there were downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth and price stability, then we will have to review and <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> the size, the timing, the design of the programme. </p>
<p>On the second point, the answer is at the present time - by the way we are fully aware, as I said before, that low interest rates for a protracted period of time <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to generate financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> - we monitor quite closely all these developments. </p>
<p>On the rest, I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> really. </p>
<p>Now, it 's very difficult to distinguish between these three sets of factors, sets of conditions, so we wo n't <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> exactly on what explanation is the most likely. </p>
<p>If there were to be financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in the stock market, for example, they would have to be addressed by the proper instruments, which is not a change in our monetary policy. </p>
<p>But certainly one lesson is that we should get used to periods of higher <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>The fourth technical condition is simply that <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> by itself generated further <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and further selling, and a fifth is poor market liquidity because of the absence of certain significant investors during this period of time. </p>
<p>At very low levels of interest rates, asset prices <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to show higher <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and in terms of the impact that this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on our monetary policy stance, the Governing Council was unanimous in its assessment that we should look through these developments and maintain a steady monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>First of all, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> increase the financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, but also it causes problems for insurance companies and for other important financial market actors. </p>
<p>In fact, the reaching of the objectives in terms of inflation and growth is predicated, is <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>, on the full implementation of the monetary policy stance as it has been designed, as it has been announced, as it has been implemented. </p>
<p>Why has n't the euro area, or more generally, Europe, been able to come up with a situation which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be considered as, I would say as normal, in this situation, as an ordinary situation? </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-07-16</b>, 47 sentences</p></div><p>I do n't want to underplay the difficulty that the ECB and the Governing Council of the ECB had in the last few weeks about having to take decisions between making sure the payment system continued to work, liquidity provision, monetary policy and not to amass excessive <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the euro system all at the same time. </p>
<p>So, as I said several times, ELA has increased from zero to <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> $ 90 billion, and now the Eurosystem has a total <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to Greece of about $ 130 billion, which makes the Eurosystem the largest depositor in Greece. </p>
<p>Then there is another requirement -- by the way, someone hinted or <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> that all these requirements were devised for Greece. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that by and large that programme has these features. </p>
<p>And we did it, however, as I said, always acting on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that Greece will be a member of the euro area. </p>
<p>The ECB has acted within its mandate and will continue to do so, under the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that Greece will remain a member of the euro area. </p>
<p>So the ECB continues to act on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that Greece is, it is of course, and will remain, a member of the euro area. </p>
<p>Especially it was addressed to several observers, policy-makers, public opinion scholars who have <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> that we should have cut ELA to Greece a long time ago. </p>
<p>So not with the provision of liquidity, which actually is regulated by a different provision, in Article 18.1 in the ECB Statute:" In order to achieve the objectives of the ESCB, the ECB and the national central banks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> conduct credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants, with lending based on adequate collateral. '' </p>
<p>But let me say one thing: for, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, the first time, the text that circulated at the level of heads of state was not generic, was quite specific. </p>
<p>What are the general conditions so as to make sure that we are always there, ready to provide the Greek economy with the needed liquidity, and at the same time we do n't <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> a bank run again? </p>
<p>My understanding is the European Council is going to discuss this report at the next meeting, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, or the meeting after that. </p>
<p>We are all aware it 's clearly in the interest of the Greek economy to have these capital controls last as little as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>Whether this <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> proves right is entirely within the responsibility both of the Greek Government and of the Member States here represented. </p>
<p>If you take the total private sector deposits in Greece, they are $ 120 billion, while the Eurosystem <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to Greece now is, as I said, about $ 130 billion. </p>
<p>And our mandate is to act based on the <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that Greece is, of course, and will be a member of the euro area. </p>
<p>And not only in that, because as you know, much of the equity, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> more than 50% of the equity of the Greek banks -- or the largest Greek banks, at least -- is formed by credits to the state. </p>
<p>And being imperfect, is fragile, is vulnerable, and does n't deliver all the benefits that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> if it were to be completed. </p>
<p>The second point is about whether the simple fact of having discussed a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> would weaken the union: well, I mean, if you phrase it this way you can see that that is not an issue. </p>
<p>In a sense what I said before <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used in several ways: I 'm not going to comment on politicians ' statements. </p>
<p>But the answer to the first point: it 's hard to <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span>. </p>
<p>It 's just one good opportunity to clarify some <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Assuming</span> that it is decided that the implementation of the referred steps and measures would be sufficient, a two-month window for PSPP -LRB- QE -RRB- purchases of Greek government bonds would open after the ESM board of governors have officially approved the first disbursement attached to the approval of the MoU. </p>
<p>But we have to be doing this in a way that we do n't run the opposite <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> which we were about to run before the imposition of capital controls, namely a bank run, which would leave all the depositors being, basically, hit. </p>
<p>This rise in interest rates <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be explained in a variety of ways, and I think we went through this last time: higher expectations of inflation, higher expected growth, or simply higher term premium. </p>
<p>So this sentence basically says what I 've said all throughout, that if we were to see an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy, which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> lead to a change in the medium-term outlook for price stability, then we would seriously think, and we have instruments to address this. </p>
<p>It 's been elaborated by the European Commission, which I want to thank for their responsiveness, for the designs capacity, and I want to thank also all the members of the European Union that have made this <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>. </p>
<p>And so that 's what I said: it will be really in the Greek Government 's capacity to respond with policy decisions, with actions, that will dispel these <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span>. </p>
<p>It 's point-in-time, it 's dynamic, it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the underlying issuer of this collateral ; what is the credit-worthiness of the underlying issuer. </p>
<p>But I would phrase it differently: do we respect the Treaty, as it is today, as it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> become tomorrow? </p>
<p>I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> what are the conditions whereby countries would not receive the assistance of the ECB. </p>
<p>But let me ask you, would you think it is legitimate for the ECB to take its decisions based on <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about a government 's capacity to implement the measures? </p>
<p>And so we are in fact <span class='uncertainty'>revising</span> our communication about ELA, because there 's absolutely no reason to keep things secret now, when we 're addressing a massive systemic problem, a macroeconomic problem. </p>
<p>Now, it was quite understandable if you had that situation, and the amounts and the modalities of ELA were to be made public, this -- it was thought, at least -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> worsen the situation of that bank at that time. </p>
<p>Now, on the first point, it 's actually -- technically I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the question about whether it was unanimous or not is not well posed. </p>
<p>So that 's why Mr Cœuré <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> -- said, actually -- that there should be frontloading. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come at the end of the first review, because that would be clear. </p>
<p>That 's very important for an area that does n't share a common budget, or a federal budget, because a Capital Markets Union would be an extraordinary assistance in sharing <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> across the Union. </p>
<p>So our accommodative monetary policy will avoid this <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of stably lower inflation in the medium term. </p>
<p>August as a month does n't come <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<p>And we do <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that our monetary policy decisions have avoided the second-round effects of a drop in oil price in January, and will continue to do so now. </p>
<p>It 's not clear which of these explanations <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be more robust. </p>
<p>The month with the second highest deposit outflow was last month, June 2015, again associated with increased political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> related to the breakdown of the negotiations and the announcement of the referendum. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span> the higher term premium is one that receives attention. </p>
<p>Yes, I never <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> your investigative capacities. </p>
<p>But certainly we discussed it in the last two meetings, there has been a considerable increase in <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, which has led to a rise in interest rates. </p>
<p>The Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> nevertheless decide even before that if there was credible implementation. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-09-03</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>One was the weakening of the major emerging market economies ; and second, we 've seen an induced <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> due to this effect and to the <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> changes in the oil prices. </p>
<p>You know, it 's true that <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is higher so the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are higher. </p>
<p>So the discussion today basically converged on an assessment that the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to output and inflation have increased ; that we 'll still monitor the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook ; and that the Governing Council emphasised, as I said a moment ago, the willingness and ability to act if warranted, by using all the instruments available within its mandate, and in particular regarding the asset purchase programme that provides by itself sufficient flexibility as far as the horizon, the size, and the parameters, as we 've seen today. </p>
<p>Let me add that the cut-off date of these projections was August 12, so the events that took place since then are a downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to the projections themselves. </p>
<p>In this present situation it 's lower because of supply effects and because demand from China and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> other emerging market economies is lower. </p>
<p>Just going back also to -- well, it 's partly related to that ; going back to the previous question as well: you see, the difference in June is that in June there was no need to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> downward our projections at all. </p>
<p>On the first question, you 're absolutely right: that 's what I said in June, and the reference was to short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> periods. </p>
<p>And so we 've just one word about the terms about our ELA communication as far as the future is concerned: the Governing Council agreed in principle that in future a national central bank <span class='uncertainty'>could</span>, together with a request for non-objection regarding ELA, seek approval from the Governing Council to communicate related elements, including the outcome of ELA, if it sees a benefit in doing so from a financial stability perspective. </p>
<p>I said it 's still premature to conclude whether these developments <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a lasting impact on output and inflation. </p>
<p>On the inflation rate, your second question, this is an increasing - -- we should n't forget that 10, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> 12, 13 years ago, a quite similar discussion was taking place, whether we should look at <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> core inflation, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> headline inflation, and we decided to look at headline inflation as our objective. </p>
<p>So lower commodity prices, a stronger euro, a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> lower growth, have increased the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to a sustainable path of inflation towards 2%. </p>
<p>It 's shared by other people ; I would n't say ` widely shared ': it would be too ambitious, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span>. </p>
<p>Christine was saying that actually, even in this case, the ELA number was gathered by you thanks to your investigative capacities because it came out before we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> announce it. </p>
<p>Lower oil prices <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be lower because of demand and/or because of supply effects. </p>
<p>Let me just, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> repeat, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> say it differently: I started saying that the economic recovery is expected to continue, but at a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> slower pace, reflecting the slowdown in emerging market economies, primarily. </p>
<p>On the second question, you 're right: one of the lingering questions was, how is it <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> that with all this <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in oil prices and exchange rates and interest rates, is n't there any financial stability problem? </p>
<p>However, downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have increased and emerging market economies ' challenges are unlikely to be quickly reversed. </p>
<p>If we are to ask what is the main source of the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> projections, I would say the main source is the change in the oil price. </p>
<p>Now, when oil prices are lower because of demand effects, then we have to consider also the negative impact that lower growth in emerging market economies <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on the growth of the euro area. </p>
<p>It 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> true that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia are higher as well. </p>
<p>The Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>tends</span> to think that these are transitory effects, mostly due to oil price effects. </p>
<p>So basically, much of what I 've been saying is that we 'll have to see whether this is actually short-term <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or is permanent <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, in which case you would observe an increase in <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia. </p>
<p>There <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> also be another reason: that simply <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have gone up. </p>
<p>If you look at, for example, inflation expectations, inflation expectations have been pretty <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>Your second question: as I think I said in the introductory statement, a review after six months was scheduled, and we found out that the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually buy more than the 25% limit in some cases where there would be no blocking minority by the ECB. </p>
<p>You should consider these projections <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> certain stock prices, certain exchange rates, certain interest rates, which are not the stock prices, the exchange rates and the interest rates that prevail over a 10 days ' average until today. </p>
<p>At the same time, we have not observed in the banking sector a substantial, significant increase in leverage, and I am deliberately very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> in saying this, limiting our observations to what we are actually observing, namely the regulated institutions subject to our supervision. </p>
<p>At the same time it clearly is a sign of the readiness of the Governing Council to adapt the parameters of the programme to the situation, so as to ensure the full implementation of the programme, because we should n't ever forget that the inflation path that is projected to reach 1.7%, if I 'm not mistaken, now after the revision, in 2017, and the growth projections, are both predicated, <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> upon the full implementation of that programme. </p>
<p>And this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be due to many causes. </p>
<p>But recently for example we had the Five Presidents ' report, which was designing a path towards greater integration, and we 've seen several episodes where you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see, you <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be actually quite optimistic, that the process is moving forward. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> see negative numbers of inflation in the coming months. </p>
<p>At the same time, we have the rest of the world, and we have these effects that we 've observed over the last few weeks -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more than a few weeks ; especially in the last few weeks -- so we 'll have to see whether these effects are transitory or are permanent. </p>
<p>There are n't special limits to the <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> that the ECB has in gearing up monetary policy. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-10-22</b>, 38 sentences</p></div><p>Of course, any very large surprise in a very large economy <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have the potential to affect confidence worldwide, and then we would have to see in which way and how to cope with that. </p>
<p>Let me add one thing about the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> changes, <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> cuts in the rate on the deposit facility: the issue there is how come we announced a year ago that that was practically the zero lower bound and now we 're thinking of going into further negative territory? </p>
<p>Well, let me state quite clearly that the credibility of a central bank is measured by its ability to comply with its mandate and to this extent any instrument <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be potentially used. </p>
<p>Second, I would say there were a few members of the Governing Council who hinted at the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of acting today, but I would n't say it was a prevailing theme of our discussion today. </p>
<p>So no <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> whatsoever about the effectiveness of our monetary policy, regardless of whether structural reforms have been implemented or not. </p>
<p>It 's quite <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> that the monetary policy measures that we 've been undertaking over the last year and a half, two years, especially, but even before, have significantly improved the financial markets, the credit markets and the money markets. </p>
<p>There are different cyclical positions ; there 's different <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to external shocks. </p>
<p>On the direct trade channel, the conclusion is the <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> of the euro area to the Chinese economy is not very significant. </p>
<p>As I 've said before, the nominal effective exchange rate has been appreciating over the last few months -- four, five months -- to a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> significant level. </p>
<p>The third point is that with very low inflation or negative inflation, the real interest rate increases, and when the nominal rate can not go below zero it means that the interest rate in real terms <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be above the equilibrium real interest rates that would equal savings to investment at the level of full employment. </p>
<p>And the conclusion of the Boskin Commission was that the way inflation is measured, in particular the type of indexes that are used, Laspeyres indexes, <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to exaggerate the measurement of inflation, in the case of the US by 1.5 percentage points. </p>
<p>Now, recent analysis <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that we should be more <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about this, because to the extent that the investment in oil production had been geared in the past on the basis of projections of demand which turned out later to be less than expected, this is also a demand-induced oil price shock, and has different consequences on inflation and inflation expectations than it would if it were a shock which was supply-determined. </p>
<p>I understand the Vice-President <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want to add something on the first question. </p>
<p>Of course, one of the downsides I mentioned before, one of the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to our inflation projections comes from the exchange rate. </p>
<p>But a more gentle way of saying no would be the following: <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, for economics, is bad. </p>
<p>However, if we were to see that the technical <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> underlying these projections have worsened, or the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are increasing and further on materialising, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well change the size, the composition, the design of all our monetary policy instruments as needed. </p>
<p>The third channel is the financial channel and again we do not see a very significant <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> of the euro area towards China. </p>
<p>However, there are some countries where such a figure is higher and reaches <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 10%, in the case of Germany. </p>
<p>Then there are the deflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> -- real deflation, not what you implied in your question, because to have negative inflation for a few months is not a deflation situation. </p>
<p>This is a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> because it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> lead to a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>Political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, however, is part of democracy. </p>
<p>On your second question, as you <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have seen in the introductory statement, there was a very rich discussion about all monetary policy instruments that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be used if warranted. </p>
<p>And the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> come from a continuing high output gap, from the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> further fall in oil prices, from the fact that the nominal effective exchange rate has appreciated in the last three or four months, if I 'm not mistaken, by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 6%, and, finally, from the fact that we continue to observe a high degree of correlation between headline inflation and medium-term inflation expectations, which means a high degree of correlation between oil prices and inflation expectations. </p>
<p>And <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> also one needs to look at the space, the fiscal space the government has. </p>
<p>But there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be other points of view on this. </p>
<p>Also, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> one of the most important differences across the euro area is, the degree of indebtedness, both in the public sector and in the private sector, of different countries. </p>
<p>It was very brief, because it 's very, very early to say what the impact <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be on the eurozone 's economy. </p>
<p>When we look at the expectations of inflation, which of course is a very relevant <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> for our monetary policy decisions, we see that since our last meeting survey-based short-term inflation expectations have declined, but medium to long-term inflation expectations, after some decline following our last meeting, have recovered and are basically unchanged since then. </p>
<p>That 's the sense of our discussion about downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>It 's clearly a very significant increase in labour supply ; however, there 's also <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> a need of significant investments in this labour supply, and also to see how these public investments in knowledge, education and so on are going to be financed is also going to make a big difference. </p>
<p>So I would say, as I said before on the occasion of a different question, it 's very early to have full visibility on the economic consequences of this phenomenon, and even more so to know what impact this <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have on our monetary policy decisions. </p>
<p>To this extent, the Governing Council has tasked the relevant committees to work on different monetary policy instruments that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> potentially be used, to examine the pros and cons of different instruments. </p>
<p>The projections of recovery both in output and inflation are based, are <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on the full implementation of the QE programme as announced in January and the full implementation of all the credit-easing measures that have been announced in the course of 2014. </p>
<p>We are not saying that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are materialising, but they are present and as I observed in the course of the last meeting these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have gone up, and we want to be vigilant, as people used to say in the old times. </p>
<p>However, we see some downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> as far as this picture is concerned. </p>
<p>We see that headline inflation will stay low for a protracted period of time, although as I just said in the introductory statement, we expect some pick-up, due mostly to base effects and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> projections of higher oil prices. </p>
<p>On the other hand, they were also based on a set of technical <span class='uncertainty'>assumptions</span> concerning exchange rates, oil prices, external demand, growth in output and so on. </p>
<p>And to the extent that these conditions change and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> worsen, we will have to adjust our QE programme or in general our monetary policy stance. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2015-12-03</b>, 19 sentences</p></div><p>They were able to do so in what regards the shortfall for the baseline stress test and asset quality review, but not for the adverse scenario, and for that they will require some money, which will be public money, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be invested into the banks in a proportion of 70% to 30%. </p>
<p>The cost of credit for the euro area, for the whole of the euro area bank lending rates, fell by <span class='uncertainty'>approximately</span> 80 basis points. </p>
<p>Our measures are contributing to raise GDP by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 1% in the years 2015 to 2017. </p>
<p>All this produced lower inflation and so we had to recalibrate, and we are going to do this on and on, if the external conditions will put at <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> the achievement of our objectives. </p>
<p>What we 've done since then is to create very favourable financial and credit market conditions so that firms and households, even though burdened by these external factors, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> find credit easier to access and more abundant. </p>
<p>And we should n't discount another fact that we have not been discussing so far: that there are a series of factors coming into play in the years ahead which <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to reduce the excess liquidity. </p>
<p>One is the repayment of the TLTRO ; another one is the demand for bank notes ; another one is the bonds purchased under the SMP programme that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> come due. </p>
<p>So we counteract this reduction and we actually <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do even more than offset these reductions, which means that the conditions for this liquidity will ensure that the bonds we purchased, and we are purchasing and will be purchasing, will stay on our balance sheet for a long time. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have localised <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> in different parts of the financial system, and they should be addressed by macroprudential policy measures, certainly not by changes in monetary policy. </p>
<p>So that 's why, first of all, try to know and learn as much as one can about these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> all the time. </p>
<p>I 've just given to you figures about credit: credit 's picking up, it 's coming back, but it 's very, very subdued yet, and we do n't see especially systemic <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>So the question that you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have about ANFA should be asked to the national central banks. </p>
<p>We are closely monitoring these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> ; we are aware that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be there. </p>
<p>No, this time I would n't say that we 've discussed the side effects and <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but it 's a discussion that we have ongoing anyway. </p>
<p>So in what regards the waiver, the main condition is that the Governing Council will be satisfied that the country under a programme is complying with the programme, and that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> even happen before the conclusion of the review, if we would be close enough to that end of the review and we would be convinced that the review would become successful. </p>
<p>I would exclude completely -- you did n't say that, but you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have thought about this in your mind -- I would exclude completely any <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of monetary financing. </p>
<p>We certainly have in mind that the situation ahead is full of geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and that 's why we have to be alert. </p>
<p>That 's why we have to be certainly continuing our effort to pursue and achieve the price stability objective, well aware that the surrounding conditions <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually get worse because of these geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Regarding the participation in QE, it 's more complex and it does not <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> only on the successful completion of the review. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-01-21</b>, 31 sentences</p></div><p>We did n't want to discuss today the specifics of the instruments, but rather to determine and assess the stance that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to take in March. </p>
<p>Second, the provisioning against these NPLs was fully determined by the comprehensive assessment, which means that no new <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> provisioning, nor new <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> requests for more capital will be made by the supervisor. </p>
<p>Whether they 're going to be transient, short-term movements, or whether they 're going to be persisting ; whether the markets will adjust to a different level or not: these are all questions that <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> market analysts are better positioned to answer. </p>
<p>Here the view of the Governing Council is that we should absolutely reject any suggestion that we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> do less than what 's necessary to achieve the objective of the inflation rate of below but close to 2% without undue delay. </p>
<p>So the stance of the Governing Council and the ECB is the following: there are global developments ; <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> they 're adverse -- very often, recently, they 're adverse -- to us reaching this objective. </p>
<p>Namely, based on tax cuts, current government expenditure control, and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> public investment with a high return, and accompanied by the structural reforms which will make potential output grow. </p>
<p>It 's quite clear that we see major movements in the marketplace, and what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the source of these movements, the causes of these movements? </p>
<p>The market behaviour with respect to banks <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> that was originated by the account of what this questionnaire was and what 's going to happen, and of course all the discussions about the bad bank, and different valuations -- you know about that as well, of course. </p>
<p>Let me say that our communication -- well, you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> notice that as far as I myself am concerned, I abstain from making comments about markets, abstain from blaming markets, as such. </p>
<p>The outlook, however, for the euro area following these developments has been, as I was saying before, <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downward, and the effect of these developments on the commodity markets is quite visible. </p>
<p>There are NPLs of different kinds, and each of them <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have a number. </p>
<p>The second point, about the objective of inflation: first of all, it 's remarkable that at a time when you have people <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that we should <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the inflation objective to something lower than 2% -- by the way, incidentally, you also have people who are saying that we should strive to have an inflation rate above 2% as well, so the camps are divided -- Professor Issing confirmed the validity of the objective of an inflation rate below but close to 2% as the Governing Council definition of price stability. </p>
<p>So one should n't have any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the Governing Council in its collective wisdom not only has the power, the willingness and the determination, but also the cohesion that 's necessary to take the actions that are needed. </p>
<p>So there should n't be any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that, and we have plenty of instruments, as you know. </p>
<p>Here I 'll read again these quite important words:" It will therefore be necessary to review and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March, when the new projections will become available. '' ' </p>
<p>But it 's entirely -- well, it 's not entirely in our hands ; it 's also in our hands, the opportunity, the capacity, the ability, the <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> to transform this development into an opportunity for future growth of Europe. </p>
<p>In a sense -- but one should be very <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> here about not being too self-complimentary -- but certainly the gyrations that we are observing in financial and commodity markets, on other occasions, in other times, would have severely tested the resilience of the banking and the financial sectors at that time, and so far we 've seen actually that they stand pretty resilient. </p>
<p>That 's a good question, because it allows me to clarify what is a significantly <span class='uncertainty'>confused</span> perception. </p>
<p>The answer as far as our monetary policy is concerned, if these market developments and this heightened <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in financial and commodity markets were to persist longer than in the short run, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well become a factor in unwanted tightening of the financing conditions, and therefore that 's one of the reasons why, as I read before, we will review and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> our monetary policy stance in March. </p>
<p>We are constantly monitoring markets and generally the financial sector, the banking sector, trying to see whether our monetary policies -- I should say not only the ECB 's monetary policy, but all the major central banks ' monetary policies -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become a source of financial <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span>. </p>
<p>And we look -- and that 's also very important for us -- we look at second-round effects, namely whether low oil prices and low commodity prices do feed into other prices, and then that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> generate exactly what we want to avoid, namely a spiralling downward phenomenon. </p>
<p>I can only give general impressions of how we view the whole phenomenon, which, as I said, is an important structural, socio-political change, but also it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become an opportunity. </p>
<p>So that 's what we are looking at, what we are monitoring, and that 's why I said we will review and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> our monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>It 's quite clear that if it were to be a short-term effect, as you <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to hint at, we would look through. </p>
<p>So we have to take seriously the fact that low oil prices, low commodity prices for a long period of time <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually have second-round effects that we definitely want to take action against. </p>
<p>So I do n't think the markets are actually disagreeing with the assessment made by the SSM, but there has been a significant amount of <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>, and I hope that this exchange will help. </p>
<p>Let me also add one other thing that 's <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> relevant in view of the impression: the Governing Council was unanimous in being committed to this line of communication. </p>
<p>And so far we have not seen signs of potential financial <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> of the like we 've seen in the pre-crisis times. </p>
<p>The circumstances were basically -- we look at several <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, but certainly we 've looked, as I think I 've said in the last press conference, at the exchange rate in effective terms ; we looked at the price of oil ; we looked at the growth prospects of emerging market economies. </p>
<p>So now these conditions have worsened, and I think, to respond to your question, the credibility of the ECB would be harmed if we were not ready to review and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> <span class='uncertainty'>reconsider</span> our monetary policy stance when we have full information. </p>
<p>And there are practices <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> from bank to bank. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-03-10</b>, 17 sentences</p></div><p>So banks face sizeable forthcoming funding needs, and so this occurs in an environment where the pricing of bank debt is <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> and <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>Also it provides funding certainty -- let 's not forget it 's a four-year operation -- at an attractive price, in an environment of increasing <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and also an environment of large upcoming bond redemptions, bank bond redemptions. </p>
<p>Well, the discussion today and the overwhelming majority with which the package was approved makes full justice of these <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about the willingness to act. </p>
<p>So it 's one more reason to consider the negative rates as <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> complex in the multifaceted banking world that we have in the eurozone. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the IMF announced today that they are going to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> downward during the spring meetings their outlook for global growth. </p>
<p>The second reason is that financial conditions have changed considerably in this period of time, and there has been a widespread <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> of high intensity for a reasonably long period of time at that intensity. </p>
<p>From today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we do n't <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p>On the TLTRO I just can give you a brief overview of what this operation is, keeping in mind there 's going to be a press briefing at four today for all the further technical details that you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be interested in. </p>
<p>The second question is, if I can rephrase," How can an expansionary monetary policy measure, or a set of measures like we 've decided today, how <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> that change a situation where debt, both public and private, is excessive? '' </p>
<p>That does not have any impact on any <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> increase in MRO rates down the road, in particular three years from now. </p>
<p>And then they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even get a reduction on that rate which increases with the amount of loans they grant. </p>
<p>And you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> know that we 've discussed for some time the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of having a tiering system, so an exemption system for this operation, and in the end the Governing Council decided not to, exactly for the purpose of not signalling that we can go as low as we want on this. </p>
<p>And this communication opens the way for a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> by supervisors of the implementation of the measures that determine the so-called MDA, the maximum distributable amount. </p>
<p>On the other point about negative rates, let me just say again what I said at the very beginning: From today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and the return to our price stability objective, we do n't <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce further rates. </p>
<p>Prima facie, it clearly involves complexities, both accounting-wise and legal-wise, for our view, but of course by this term" helicopter money '' one <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> mean many different things, and so we have to see that. </p>
<p>The fact that negative rates push down the whole yield curve, because by opening up the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> in terms of expectations for future rates that the rates will be very low, the whole yield curve is lowered. </p>
<p>And they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even get a reduction on that rate which increases with the amount of loans they grant. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-04-21</b>, 21 sentences</p></div><p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is shared, it 's fully shared. </p>
<p>If I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> respond to the second question, by saying that we have n't yet examined completely the details of this. </p>
<p>There are <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> combinations of concerns with overconcentration of sovereign debt in the portfolio of some banks, by changing the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> weights accordingly and creating then a price disincentive for the accumulation of <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> excessive holdings. </p>
<p>It clearly involves complexities, both accounting-wise, legal-wise ; and it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> mean different things to different people. '' </p>
<p>And this combines with the global <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that was, I would say, highlighted during the IMF meetings in Washington. </p>
<p>And inflation remains very low, will <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> be negative in the coming months. </p>
<p>And the inflation rate would have been negative this year, and if I 'm not mistaken -- it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be I am -- about half a percentage point less over the following two years. </p>
<p>It 's in itself a consideration, a reflection, that comes out of the crisis, and a consideration of proper treatment of credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in the accounts of banks. </p>
<p>On your other two questions, I can only say that the monetary policy measures that we have enacted in March had the effect of avoiding the second-round effects caused by the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> of the beginning of the year that would have had an impact on our medium-term outlook. </p>
<p>So our position -- which has also been discussed in the macroprudential forum where we have the Governing Council and the Supervisory Board at the same time -- our position has been that first, there is reason to change the present system of zero <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> weights ; second, that the revision should not create undue <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in markets where sovereign debt is used, like for instance the repo market and in general short-term money markets ; and third, that it should be a change in the international standard, meaning, coming out of the Basel Committee discussion -- a principle, by the way, that is also mentioned in the Five Presidents ' Report: that annual revision of the sovereign debt <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> weight regime should be decided in an international context to ensure a level playing field. </p>
<p>The answer is no, we do n't see a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of scarcity, and we have not discussed other measures. </p>
<p>Since then, broad financing conditions have improved, also in the context of receding <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion at global level. </p>
<p>We do expect a continuation of market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, certainly until the referendum ; I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about the outcome of the referendum, but <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> even after the referendum. </p>
<p>In answer to your first question, a polite, lively debate <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even be welcome, because it helps us to explain better our monetary policies, and their shape and their success. </p>
<p>But I am aware that to explain real rates to savers <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be difficult. </p>
<p>Certainly the discussion about this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> has already produced some significant consequences on the markets, for example a depreciation of sterling, quite significant. </p>
<p>Now, of course we 've got to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> here because we talk about the aggregate of the banking system in the euro area, and of course aggregates <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually conceal different realities. </p>
<p>And in answering this way, I will also in a sense <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> my answer to your first question, and I 'll read -- I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> by and large it 's the same words as the statement:" At our March meeting we decided on a comprehensive package of measures to ease financing conditions, stimulate new credit provision, and thereby reinforce the momentum of the euro area recovery and accelerate the return of inflation to levels below but close to 2%. </p>
<p>Our recent measures have been instrumental in avoiding that the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> that we observed earlier this year did not undermine the pass-through of our accommodative stance. '' </p>
<p>The assessment of our staff is that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of this happening is limited. </p>
<p>But certainly criticisms of a certain type <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be viewed or perceived as endangering the independence of the ECB, and therefore causing the sort of behaviour that you hinted at, namely delaying investment, delaying taking <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-06-02</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>We 've seen that the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> mass of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> has shifted upward, although it 's not a dramatic effect at all, and then we will be in a better position to answer your question. </p>
<p>At the same time we had data on core inflation for the first few months of this year, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the first three months of this year, which came out weaker. </p>
<p>We expect the recovery to continue, at <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> a slower pace in the second quarter, but still a good figure. </p>
<p>To the first question, no, we think our measures make a lot of difference, and have made a lot of difference in the sense of being very effective, even with the present pace of structural reforms which <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be faster. </p>
<p>And we see that basically the March package has been instrumental in avoiding a severe deterioration of financial conditions after the <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> around the end of last year, and certainly has supported the recovery. </p>
<p>And then as a micro-supervisor, the SSM will establish plans to have supervisory actions to individual banks to speed up the work-out of NPLs in order as quickly as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to address that problem, working on the balance sheet of the banks, which of course implies that it will take some time. </p>
<p>And this is because of what I said before, namely that we do n't see, with the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> exception of Germany, any substantial pressure in the wage and price mechanisms. </p>
<p>But as I said, <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> the second quarter will produce a slightly lower figure. </p>
<p>And if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> say so, Mr President, we at the Governing Council are going to discuss this in more detail. </p>
<p>To the first question I 'll answer, basically, reading again what is in the introductory statement: additional stimulus beyond the impetus already taken into account is expected from the monetary policy measures still to be implemented, namely the TLTRO II and the CSPP, and will contribute to further rebalancing the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to the outlook for growth and inflation. </p>
<p>In other words, what we are saying is that we have the June Eurosystem staff projections, and what 's called the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> mass of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> over the years 2017 and 2018 has shifted slightly upward. </p>
<p>But at the same time, in the midst of what one would qualify as good news as far as growth and employment are concerned, we still see no substantial pressures on the wage and price-setting mechanisms, with the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> exception of Germany. </p>
<p>The length of the medium term <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the nature of the shock and on the size of the shock. </p>
<p>That effect by itself would raise the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium, and in so doing it would increase real interest rates and would go against the objective that we have of price stability but also against restoring growth. </p>
<p>And some say," Oh, you should <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> it upward and go to 3% or 4%, because in this way you will elicit expectations that you will go up with your policies. '' </p>
<p>Some people say we should <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> it downward and simply accept the fact that we 'll never reach 2%, and we should take 1% or 0%. </p>
<p>`` Why do n't you <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the inflation target? '' </p>
<p>The ECB is ready for all <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span>. </p>
<p>So the ECB has a view whereby the UK should remain in the European Union, because the European Union would benefit from its permanence, and we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the UK too would benefit from staying in the European Union. </p>
<p>So in certain circumstances labour market reforms <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have priority ; in other circumstances, product market reforms <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have priority. </p>
<p>I 've commented about the rebalancing of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, to that picture. </p>
<p>And that will certainly elicit in the future, in the coming months, monetary policies that <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> certainly not to converge ; <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> diverge. </p>
<p>You did n't say it but you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have implied it: whether accommodative monetary policy removes the incentive to carry out structural reforms. </p>
<p>But as I said, the exchange rate is the outcome of several other factors: what happens with other geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that we have identified ; what happens with the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are near to us, concerning the United Kingdom decision ; it 's also the outcome of the behaviour of the price of oil and many other factors. </p>
<p>So that is simple, but it 's very important to make it clear, because there has been <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span>. </p>
<p>There are some conversations in the market about potential limits that this programme <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> meet. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-07-21</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>That 's what we are accountable for and that 's what we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> we will succeed in. </p>
<p>The message that will <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> come out - -- well, the message that will come out, the message that I can foresee or expect to come out, will be a message of stability, and the message that will come out specifically from the eurozone will be a message of a recovery that continues, though at a slower pace, in the midst of great <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>. </p>
<p>The only thing we can say is that it 's a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that has materialised, and it 's a downside <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>And in this climate of general <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, not necessarily economic <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> but <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> mostly geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, it 's very important that a message of stability comes out of the G20. </p>
<p>I said it before: <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span>, large <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> prevail, because first of all these figures will in the end <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on how long is going to be the stretch of time for these negotiations to be completed and therefore to give a certain outlook, which we do n't have with us today ; and second, these figures will also <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on what kind of outcome is going to come out. </p>
<p>Now in the case of Turkey it 's very likely that all these events <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> affect the confidence, but it 's very difficult to foresee significant impact on the eurozone recovery, at least in the immediate future. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Uncertainties</span> that are not only -- or not especially, actually -- coming from the eurozone, but they come from various parts of the world. </p>
<p>There was also a good case for the ECB to be part of this, so that the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually have information about the solvency and about the financial stability of the states where the monetary policy counterparties would reside. </p>
<p>But when we look at the consequences, the impact that our monetary policy measures had on financial markets, I think there is no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that they 've been highly effective. </p>
<p>In other words, can we have a debt restructuring mechanism in absence of a common budget, or the <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> more advanced idea of a common fiscal policy? </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the Commission has come out with a similar figure of 0.25% to 0.5%. </p>
<p>On the first question, the changes that are being <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be rational in their own sake, but it 's very important that they take place in the proper framework. </p>
<p>And the European Parliament did n't <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> so. </p>
<p>As far as your other question is concerned, it 's about, I would say, the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> execution difficulties that our QE programme <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have to face. </p>
<p>So everything has to be really analysed with all the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> behind such a concept. </p>
<p>On your second question, I just simply reiterate what I said before: I said that over the coming months, when we have more information, including new staff projections, we will be in a better position to <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the underlying macroeconomic conditions and likely paths and so on. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> actually come back on it later on. </p>
<p>I would n't say we consider it a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, as you said, but certainly it has to be addressed. </p>
<p>Bank equity prices are of some significance for policymakers, because if they drop in the way they did, one would <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span>, if this is to stay, cost of capital would increase, and therefore the net return on lending would decrease and would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> on the banking side a more conservative lending behaviour. </p>
<p>But also other policy measures are needed in order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy, and one of them is to address the non-performing loans and more generally non-performing <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> in the euro area. </p>
<p>In other words, the legislative changes should be such that the legacy NPLs <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be adequately addressed. </p>
<p>As I said before, we discussed the general economic conditions and we concluded that we did n't have yet information to take decisions, and we decided, as I said, that over the coming months when we have more information, including new staff projections, we 'll be in a better position to <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the underlying macroeconomic conditions. </p>
<p>What I know is that on inflation outlook, Brexit did n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have any major impact at this point in time. </p>
<p>On your second question, Turkey: it 's very difficult to understand how these big geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> would affect the recovery, because the channels are not obvious. </p>
<p>And this certainly involves a revision of existing personal and corporate bankruptcy legislation, but also other actions, and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> also having a public backstop when at times of exceptional circumstances the NPL market is not well functioning, and certainly we want to avoid fire sales. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-09-08</b>, 16 sentences</p></div><p>But I 've always been a little puzzled by the idea that is <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> conveyed with these words. </p>
<p>They will look at all the options that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be used to redesign the programme under the new constellation of interest rates, and then we will have, of course, a discussion in the Governing Council about issues like the one you mention and others as well. </p>
<p>After all, before the financial crisis, we have seen several countries in the eurozone increasing their government expenditure, and really drawing very little benefit in terms of output growth and employment, showing <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> that size is not the first thing one should look at, but rather how this money is being spent. </p>
<p>So again, I can repeat, the existing projections are predicated, remain <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>, on exceptionally supportive financing conditions, which to a large extent do reflect our monetary policy, and therefore the Governing Council tasked the committees. </p>
<p>And that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be said in different words. </p>
<p>`` Importantly, '' -- importantly --" the projected path of inflation remains <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on exceptionally supportive financing conditions which to a large extent reflect our accommodative monetary policy. '' </p>
<p>And your question was, since your <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> is that it was weakly effective, then" would you consider doing more of that? '' </p>
<p>Surveys show that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> aversion is no longer a factor in lending, but it 's actually competition between banks that 's driving lending. </p>
<p>Well, I do n't want to go through the list of financial <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, namely interest rates, equity prices, et cetera, that have improved dramatically since the beginning of our non-conventional monetary policies. </p>
<p>Let me also say, however, that these expectations are subject to considerable <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, and that we have observed even in the past disconnect between the behaviour of these expectations and the behaviour of, for example, oil prices. </p>
<p>Let me also add that all the evidence we have about <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of deflation measures, for example, they have not increased. </p>
<p>But let me say one thing, which is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the thing that matters most: while in the previous time we had observed fragmentation and we had observed very subdued credit developments, nowadays we can safely say that fragmentation is over ; that credit is growing constantly and has been growing constantly since the beginning of 2014, month after month ; that spreads that were dramatically fragmenting credit between different parts of the euro area, and different companies -- between large corporates and SMEs -- have vastly disappeared in the sense that they just reflect now what are <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> differentials and nothing more than that. </p>
<p>Let me also say that from any bank lending survey, it <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that now credit is indeed reaching the non-financial sector of the economy, both for private companies and households. </p>
<p>It does <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on many other <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span>, one of which is the state of the economy, and of course for us what matters is price stability, because we have this in our mandate. </p>
<p>The third consideration is that, some people are saying, negative interest rates would carry the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of cash hoarding, hoarding cash. </p>
<p>So the conclusion of this reasoning is that we are monitoring these developments very closely, and we stand ready to act if we were to detect the signals that there <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be second-round effects at play here. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-10-20</b>, 13 sentences</p></div><p>Bail-in rules are in place and they have enough flexibility that would allow to cope with a variety of <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span>. </p>
<p>Having said that, I do n't see at the present time any such outcome or any such <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<p>It 's very difficult to answer about my expectation of a market reaction following kind of a <span class='uncertainty'>random</span> statement made by somebody who did n't have any clue or information about that. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> it 's also important to say what we did not discuss, and we did n't discuss tapering or the intended horizon -- and here comes the second question -- of our asset purchase programme. </p>
<p>Second, loan demand <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on many factors other than monetary policy, and we 'll have to see what is the current economic situation concerning these two countries. </p>
<p>The market-based inflation expectations have been more <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> as they are based on financial instruments, and therefore the market developments for these instruments do affect, in a sense, also the expectations. </p>
<p>People <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have different views about that, but the impression is not at all of a political war here. </p>
<p>On your first question: actually I never thought that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> profit out of <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> moves coming from unauthorised and <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> uninformed sources. </p>
<p>The answer to the second question is that my perception is that the <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> stop, as it was outlined before, is not in anybody 's mind. </p>
<p>So we monitor financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> ; we have not seen any systemic bubble of any kind. </p>
<p>Until then it 's premature to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about purchasing bonds. </p>
<p>Though we have to be aware that certain stable pieces of evidence, like for example the correlation between inflation expectations and actual inflation, or inflation expectations and the oil price, have been themselves very <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>I think this is part of the more general category of financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2016-12-08</b>, 25 sentences</p></div><p>At that time the outlook for a sustained return to our inflation objective was much darker, and deflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were not immaterial at that time. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Uncertainty</span> prevails everywhere, and we 'll certainly see and assess the progress of the overall situation at the end of 2017. </p>
<p>So there is a big <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, much of which is political, and whether we can do something about that or not is an open question. </p>
<p>And more specifically the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation has largely disappeared. </p>
<p>But I should stress the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, because we are still at a very early stage. </p>
<p>So it 's very difficult to assess what is the medium - / long-term consequence of a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> -- change in the US administration economic policy. </p>
<p>When I referred to dominant political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, I was not saying something extravagant or difficult or unforeseen: just look at the election calendar for the year to come. </p>
<p>So that is by itself a source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>So first of all, we know one thing: markets were more resilient, and this has <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> many reasons, many causes, one of which is certainly the good work that regulators have done in the last seven, eight years to strengthen the intermediaries and the markets. </p>
<p>So while we do n't have any indication that higher prices for some specific types of collateral are hampering the transmission of our monetary policy, we have nevertheless discussed what the ECB <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> do, and I just announced one of the things that will be detailed in the 3:30 p.m. announcement. </p>
<p>Having said that, countries that need reforms have to undertake them regardless of what is the general political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, because the best way for countries to cope with this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is actually to restore growth and employment and job creation. </p>
<p>However, <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> prevails. </p>
<p>No, at this point in time frankly we do n't see <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the euro area. </p>
<p>They give credibility to the governments that comply with these rules, and even <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more importantly, they increase trust between governments. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be fairly far away from any such high-class problem. </p>
<p>The fact that structural reforms and convergence are being pursued in various countries is important, not necessarily because it causes <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for the euro but because it strengthens our monetary union. </p>
<p>Well, the word has several meanings <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on who is using it, but the natural way to look at a word like that is to have a policy whereby purchases would gradually go to zero. </p>
<p>As far as the size is concerned, it really <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on whether the countries have fiscal space or not, and we always stress the fact that fiscal policy should respect the Stability and Growth Pact. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the relevant committees will look in January and in the coming months when this <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become a necessity. </p>
<p>Well, it 's an important change after many years that oil prices had gone down to, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, an unprecedented extent ; now they 're rising again, and the explanations are, in a sense, symmetric to what were the explanations for their downfall. </p>
<p>First of all, the Governing Council is acting in a pragmatic and flexible way to cope with <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> materialise in this period of time. </p>
<p>We went back to when we increased the size in March, and we asked ourselves what were the conditions of the economy at that time, what were the prospects of a sustained return to our objective of inflation, what were the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of potential deflation. </p>
<p>And we also saw that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation, the inflation distribution are much more skewed towards out of deflation. </p>
<p>As you know, the amounts of purchases and the maturities of purchases do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the current constellation of rates, and as this changes so it changes the necessity to buy certain maturities rather than others. </p>
<p>But since <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> prevails everywhere, that 's the reason for this sentence in the introductory statement that says," If, in the meantime, the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the path of inflation, the Governing Council intends to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. '' </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-01-19</b>, 9 sentences</p></div><p>So the outlook for headline inflation over the next quarter or two quarters <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> is higher than it was foreseen in the previous macroeconomic projections. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span> not ; <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> there are other things if we look around. </p>
<p>But also, whether it will have economic consequences will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the shape of the outcome and the length of time it will take. </p>
<p>Well, if you go back three, four years ago and you ask yourself which policies were in place that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually create jobs and expand economic activity, then you see that the recovery gradually firmed up driven by consumption and investment thanks to the extraordinary financing conditions that the monetary policy of the ECB has created. </p>
<p>But we stand ready to upgrade the strategy or to <span class='uncertainty'>revise</span> the strategy as needed. </p>
<p>So the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation according to any measure has largely disappeared. </p>
<p>The discussion was unanimous in looking back at the monetary policy decisions taken in December and stating that they were the right policy answer to the <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> as viewed, as estimated in December. </p>
<p>On top of that we see, as I mentioned in the introductory statement, the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> coming from the global <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> situation. </p>
<p>It 's been very important in anchoring inflation expectations at the time especially when there was a danger they <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> become de-anchored. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-03-09</b>, 37 sentences</p></div><p>So at the same time, the projections are <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on the full implementation of the monetary policy measures that I have just read out. </p>
<p>We do n't know yet how these <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> events will reverberate on the economic situation. </p>
<p>But whatever arrangement <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be found is going to be an open arrangement ; namely ready to welcome any other country that would like to join. </p>
<p>So my understanding of this is that whatever arrangement <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be found, it is not clear yet which specific area would be addressed by this arrangement. </p>
<p>Now, given that the political situations in different countries are different, it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well happen that countries are not equally ready to move together towards working together. </p>
<p>But that urgency that was prompted by the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation is n't there ; that was the judgement, the assessment of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>The third block was a discussion about <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, about the economic situation, how it has evolved. </p>
<p>That is the key <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> that we should look at ; it 's not the only one but it 's certainly key. </p>
<p>Now, as I said, the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of an expectation that will actually materialise into lower level has gone down, given what I just said about the rest, about the progress we 've made. </p>
<p>I said from today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we do n't <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p>So it 's not that one is convinced or unconvinced all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span>. </p>
<p>Again there was a general recognition that the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has improved certainly as far as growth is concerned. </p>
<p>But in a different way the euro, I was saying before, has been the cornerstone, the pillar upon which the single market <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> survive and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> prosper and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase prosperity of the member countries. </p>
<p>Nuances <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have been different but I do n't think -- and in any event, I am not able to compare the degree of consensus today with the degree of consensus last time. </p>
<p>But I do n't know enough about the specificities of this statement to elaborate more than that ; <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I will know more tonight. </p>
<p>We asked ourselves, what <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be the reasons, the causes for these interest rate movements? </p>
<p>Now, on the other point, I do n't want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>The first two causes <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be pretty relevant, pretty significant -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> more significant than our asset purchase programme. </p>
<p>We are in a quite <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> stage of our analysis so what I 'm going to tell today is just very provisional. </p>
<p>Now, on the other point, as you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> imagine this question was asked at the time of the OMT, at the time of the London speech in 2012. </p>
<p>If we move to inflation, I would say that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation have largely disappeared. </p>
<p>In our introductory statement there is a reference to geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> or geo-global <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>So we know that these are <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> events. </p>
<p>Let me just read ; the last one was on July 24, 2016 by the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Chengdu," We reiterate that excessive <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. </p>
<p>So we are all asking ourselves -- there are certain <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that are unambiguously negative. </p>
<p>That is a fair assessment -- although we 've got to be very, very careful about this assessment because our experience of the last year and a half has been that we were expecting some significant economic impact from the various <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that have been materialising. </p>
<p>By the way, incidentally, in just giving you these numbers about employment, let me add, those who had <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about the equity of our asset purchase programme are being answered because the most equitable measure of all is to create employment and to decrease unemployment. </p>
<p>The importance of domestic <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has decreased and the geopolitical global <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> share of importance, if anything, has gone up. </p>
<p>But I am saying this because that 's certainly a relevant <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> source that we have taken into account in our discussion. </p>
<p>That was of course because of the direct benefits that such membership <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> bring, but also because of a sense of solidarity that such a membership would entail. </p>
<p>But <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> we want to come back on this next time to have a definite view on that. </p>
<p>If one wants to assess the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> as it has been evolving over say the five, six months we would say that the domestic sources of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> have been more contained. </p>
<p>Now, these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, some of them have materialised but we have n't seen yet a significant economic impact. </p>
<p>Now, always in facing critical moments we <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to underplay our achievements in the past. </p>
<p>Having said that, very much in the spirit of our forward guidance, it 's there and it 's potentially an instrument that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be used if the economic situation will warrant that. </p>
<p>But so far, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> a year and a half has passed from the British referendum -- <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> I am not sure I 'm right -- but about eight months, nine months, yes and we have n't seen yet a consequence. </p>
<p>In other words, countries <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to grow more together ; an all-time low since 1997. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-04-27</b>, 40 sentences</p></div><p>The situation has improved since then, but <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> remain. </p>
<p>Indicators of pipeline pressures show <span class='uncertainty'>tentative</span> signs of build-up of producers ' prices and upward pressure at the early stages of the pricing chain. </p>
<p>As far as the second point, let 's read it together:" Since our meeting in early March confirmed that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly solid '' -- so it 's a process in evolution --" and that downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have further diminished '' -- so it takes stock about downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>: so far they have diminished, and the cyclical recovery is becoming increasingly solid. </p>
<p>So it 's an evolution that we see from survey data <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> continue. </p>
<p>The short-term outlook was <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> down due to lower oil prices and a weaker starting point for underlying inflation. </p>
<p>And add to this also <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> negative surprises in some emerging market economies: that 's also a source. </p>
<p>One interesting fact is that over the past few months the balance between these two <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> has slightly changed. </p>
<p>We always <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that in fact -- we should n't think that it 's over. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> say that one thing, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> -- but one has to be very <span class='uncertainty'>tentative</span> in this -- one thing that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have come out of the meetings is that <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of protectionism, trade protectionism, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> receded. </p>
<p>So to the extent that political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> has this effect, we internalise this information -- together with lots of other information -- in taking our monetary policy decisions. </p>
<p>And the answer is, to the extent and only to the extent that -- we do n't react to political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> by itself, but we certainly internalise the information that comes from the fact that political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> affect our medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>We do n't do monetary policy on the likely outcomes of elections, but of course we ask ourselves how political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> can affect our monetary policy decisions. </p>
<p>The headline really is this:" The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> surrounding the euro area growth outlook, while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. '' </p>
<p>And that 's where the structural reforms come very useful, to create this environment where this transfer <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> happen, and therefore productivity <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> increase, with corresponding increase in wages. </p>
<p>Wage growth has been picking up slightly from a very subdued level, yet the outlook for wage growth remains <span class='uncertainty'>uncertain</span>. </p>
<p>The second point is that certainly markets are in the course -- not us, but markets -- are in the course of <span class='uncertainty'>reassessment</span> of the US fiscal policy. </p>
<p>In a sense, the domestic sources of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> have diminished, and global, geo-global sources of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> have increased. </p>
<p>Of course the final outcome will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the shape that the final negotiation will have, how long it will take ; but it 's quite clear that even now this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the length and the shape is producing economic consequences. </p>
<p>Let me also add that as far as inflation or <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to inflation outlook are concerned, there were n't really <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views. </p>
<p>Basically the spreads do by and large reflect different <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> situations, <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premia. </p>
<p>And the employment figure is even more impressive: euro area employment increased by <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 5 million jobs over the last three and a half years, offsetting virtually all of the employment losses seen over the crisis period. </p>
<p>No, the one that is not equal exactly like in the last statement is the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> sentence, which repeated twice that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> remained tilted on the downside in the last statement, and you can find it only once on the second page. </p>
<p>We actually have a very subdued underlying inflation rate and <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> headline inflation led by developing oil prices and unprocessed food prices. </p>
<p>First of all, we have two sets of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>In the end, the Governing Council agreed about this language that basically says -- the one I 've read before -- that says the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> surrounding the euro area growth outlook, while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. </p>
<p>The discussion focused really on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> concerning growth, not inflation. </p>
<p>Market-based inflation expectations, however, have shown a behaviour -- they had been increasing until February ; then they declined ; now they kind of <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be there, and they do reflect an underlying behaviour of the inflation <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> premium, which in turn reflects mostly developments outside the eurozone, in the United States, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> some political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> everywhere. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation have virtually disappeared. </p>
<p>However, the survey-based measures <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> the long-term inflation expectations have remained anchored. </p>
<p>Also one of the symptoms of fragmentation, which was the difference in loan rates, both funding rates for banks and lending rates, now has <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> disappeared. </p>
<p>The current wording of our forward guidance reflects exactly this assessment of side effects, and from today 's standpoint I do n't see cause to <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> from the indications we 've been consistently providing in the introductory statement. </p>
<p>It 's quite clear that as growth perspectives improve, certainly the <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> of these tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> go down, but we are not there yet. </p>
<p>On the first question, we actually had a discussion exactly on the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, as far as growth is concerned, not inflation. </p>
<p>So from today 's standpoint there is no reason to <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> from the indications we have been consistently providing in the introductory statement to this press conference. </p>
<p>The unemployment rate is at the lowest since May 2009, though it 's still at 9.5%, and this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> tell something about the need to do structural reforms, because there 's no <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some of this unemployment is structural and not cyclical. </p>
<p>In other words, the easing biases are meant to cope with tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> concerning the inflation rate, not growth directly. </p>
<p>We base our estimates on a variety of indicators, so in this sense we avoid the trap of being linked to a precise number which <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on a variety of factors, and we use a fairly wide range of indicators to inspire and inform our policy-making. </p>
<p>On page 2 you have:" Moreover, the ongoing <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in headline inflation underlines the need... '' </p>
<p>And some of the members had, I would say, a more sanguine view of the economic situation, and others, while acknowledging that there have been improvements, on which I will say a few words later on, in the growth outlook, <span class='uncertainty'>believed</span> that such improvements would not warrant any change in communication as far as the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> is concerned. </p>
<p>One of which, speaking of leverage, is given by the fragility in the banking sector and the NPL stocks in many countries that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have a much higher credit growth had it not been for the NPLs. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-06-08</b>, 26 sentences</p></div><p>And the pass-through of our monetary policy decisions has <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> never been as effective as it is today. </p>
<p>So the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of deflation has dissipated. </p>
<p>I 've just said, by the way, that growth has been just <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> from 0.5% to 0.6% in the first quarter, and so the annual growth for this year is projected to be 2% rather than 1.9%. </p>
<p>So in some sense it 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> working, but through different channels. </p>
<p>It 's part of a reaction function and it does say that if things were to turn less favourable -- and here, just stop a moment: if things were to turn less favourable, it 's a set of <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> which is more benign than the tail-risk <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> embodied in the expectation on rates, and as such it 's still there. </p>
<p>And then we have medium - or long-term horizons where new changes in the economic and monetary union <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be introduced, but they do require a more extensive change in our treaties, in our treaty foundations. </p>
<p>But certainly, those countries which have a weak budget position and low growth and lack of structural reforms will be, certainly, more affected than others by a <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> increase in interest rates. </p>
<p>Second, there are always countries that <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span>, countries that lag behind. </p>
<p>And I think one of the signs <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be that right now we have the highest inflation rate in the euro area. </p>
<p>At the same time, since we have stronger confidence in the path of inflation convergence and we 've seen that the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation have definitely disappeared, we felt confident in removing the easing bias as far as the interest rate was concerned. </p>
<p>More generally, structural reforms that have taken place are good for growth, certainly, and are good ultimately in the medium/long term for employment, but also, in making the markets more flexible -- especially the labour market more flexible -- do <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to produce a lower growth in nominal wages. </p>
<p>And we also see that the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the path of inflation has also decreased. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be that this is actually slowing the growth of nominal wages as well. </p>
<p>If we look at the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> dimension of inflation, we see two phenomena. </p>
<p>So deflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are not there any longer, and that 's why we have removed one of our easing biases, which was exactly addressing the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of the inflation path. </p>
<p>The lower -- the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that the DFR, deposit facility rate, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> go lower -- was predicated on the strengthening or the materialisation of this tail <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>And <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> 5 million jobs have been created in the eurozone in the last three and a half years. </p>
<p>On the first question, we removed the interest rate easing bias because the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the future path of inflation have disappeared. </p>
<p>There is going to be also in the coming months, by the way, a significant amount of <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> due to oil prices and food prices, but the underlying inflation is basically staying what it is today. </p>
<p>First of all, the downward revisions in inflation: as a matter of fact, very little has changed as far as inflation is concerned, because it was 1.9% in April, if I remember, and we all remember the serious concerns, if not the outcries, that inflation was going up too much, and now it 's 1.4%, and it 's mostly -- actually, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> entirely -- driven by the price of oil and price of foods. </p>
<p>If things were to turn out in a way that these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> were to reappear, we 'd certainly be ready to lower rates. </p>
<p>The first is that tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have disappeared. </p>
<p>That is to say, deflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have definitely gone away. </p>
<p>With respect to the second question, I kind of answered an <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> similar question a moment ago, namely, the programme is running now smoothly and when and if we face problems we 'll use the flexibility that the programme itself embodies. </p>
<p>So I guess it 's to be welcomed, this new work on strengthening the monetary union, especially having in mind that we need to repair the fragilities that have <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span> in the last few years in the union. </p>
<p>There are many reasons, and some of them <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be more important than others -- it 's hard to say which is which -- but basically the reasons that are behind this are certain structural changes that have taken place, one of which is certainly the backward-looking negotiation of nominal wages, looking as a sort of reference of inflation, looking at low inflation rates as a basis for current negotiations. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-07-20</b>, 18 sentences</p></div><p>Stimulus upon which all the path of inflation is projected, is <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span>. </p>
<p>Well, if the Governing Council had decided to define autumn as 7 September, we <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> would have said that 7 September is going to be when we 'll decide. </p>
<p>And that 's why I said before: in the presence of this growth recovery, if we are to experience an unwanted tightening of financing conditions that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> jeopardise the convergence in the medium term of inflation to our objectives, then we 'll have to act and we 'll have to use the APP bias and other measure as well. </p>
<p>That in fact, as you said, there are spots which have n't seen such great recovery, and they, in a sense, do n't <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> when we give this average, aggregate description. </p>
<p>By the way, the whole reasoning <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be done the other way around, if we had inflation 4% and we wanted to bring it down, and we decided that 4% is the new objective. </p>
<p>I focused on the labour market, but in fact there are other reasons why this response <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be delayed. </p>
<p>There is a lot of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> around. </p>
<p>Bank lending rates continue to be at very supportive levels, and the Bank Lending Survey <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that banks expect a further net easing of their credit standards across all loan categories in the third quarter. </p>
<p>So I think that what should be improved, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> on both sides, is the way to work together, not necessarily our hiring practices, which, as I said, when they need correction, we correct them without hesitation. </p>
<p>In the speech in Sintra and before, we said that reflation has replaced deflation -- or <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation, really, better. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Sometimes</span> their concerns are right ; <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> they are not. </p>
<p>For example, the labour market slack <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be bigger than previously estimated, but as the economic situation and growth improves, so will the labour market, and this will be absorbed, '' and so on for all these various reasons. </p>
<p>So it 's premature to talk about other things, and what you <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, or also other programmes. </p>
<p>Then we said that our monetary policy will accompany the recovery, and that is, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, not only in Sintra, but also in Tallinn, and certainly today. </p>
<p>There was a general reiteration of the point that convergence of the inflation to our objectives remains <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> upon the very substantial monetary accommodation that is now in place. </p>
<p>Now, the last thing that the Governing Council <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> want is actually an unwanted tightening of the financing conditions that either slows down this process or <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> even jeopardise it ; and that 's why we retain the second bias, or let 's call it, reaction function. </p>
<p>So, all in all, one <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> try to summarise the exchange of views we had saying that it was around the concepts that we 've expanded on on other occasions, like the concept of confidence that is basically generated by the growth momentum ; but also the fact that we need to be persistent and patient, because we are n't there yet. </p>
<p>We reviewed the economic and financial developments in the euro area, where we took stock of the continuing improvement in growth momentum, but also of the fact that the inflation rate is still subdued - and really there is n't any convincing sign of pickup for underlying inflation - while noting that the headline inflation will still be fairly <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> in the coming months. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-09-07</b>, 33 sentences</p></div><p>Now on the potential financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> stemming from monetary policies that are very accommodating for a long time, it certainly is a danger, but do we see that now? </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Probably</span> the bulk of these decisions will be taken in October. </p>
<p>I should say just before you ask me other questions, the discussion was very, very <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> and was meant to ask questions about the different scenarios and what the transmission channels or different scenarios was rather than expressing policy options or policy preferences. </p>
<p>As you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> remember, the change allowing purchases below the DFR -- the Deposit Facility Rate -- and below two-year maturities considerably expanded the eligible universe of our programme, giving it more flexibility. </p>
<p>But there was by and large broad consensus on the fact, as I just read in the introductory statement, that the recent <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the exchange rate represents a source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which requires monitoring with regard to its <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>One can naturally explain very clearly that whenever one has sort of <span class='uncertainty'>appeared</span>, when people <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to say," Oh, you bought more bonds of one country and less of another '' it 's happened because of temporary technical factors that have been corrected in the subsequent months and weeks, weeks, and months. </p>
<p>As I said before, unless a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that is not seen today materialises, we should be ready to give the bulk or to take the bulk of these decisions in October. </p>
<p>So the discussions about different scenarios concerned the length of the programme, the size of the monthly flows and so it was, as I said, a very <span class='uncertainty'>preliminary</span> discussion mostly geared to ask questions. </p>
<p>It 's so important that the medium-term outlook for inflation was <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downward in the staff projections mainly due to the appreciation of the exchange rate, which means that we will have to take into account this element in our information set in our future policy decisions. </p>
<p>It 's <span class='uncertainty'>roughly</span> around $ 1.18 and was August 14th so we will have to see. </p>
<p>So these <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the capital key do n't indicate anything else from what I said. </p>
<p>But even looking at growth, how this recovery remains <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on our monetary policy... Basically, if you look at the drivers of the economy, you see that consumption is doing well. </p>
<p>No, we have n't discussed really the scarcity issue because so far we 've given plenty of evidence that whenever there were... by the way these problems, these <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> were present at the very beginning of our programme. </p>
<p>Now, the important aspect of the current discussion, that 's your first question, about the European monetary union, its reforms is that the member states have realised how incomplete is our monetary union at the present time and how such <span class='uncertainty'>incompleteness</span> has made the crisis that we are just coming out of more serious than it would have otherwise been. </p>
<p>There have always been temporary <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the capital key for the simple reason that some countries do not participate in the QE programme ; Greece and Cyprus. </p>
<p>All this <span class='uncertainty'>hinges</span> on low interest rates. </p>
<p>I do n't know if they have been very successful in helping the central bank to get out of the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>Also consider another factor to this ; that in judging the medium-term impact of a certain change in one of the financing conditions <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> -- and the exchange rate is indeed one important one -- one also takes into account the credibility of our monetary policy. </p>
<p>Now, on the second point, I do n't think we are in a period of high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> ; I think we are starting what to do next year when the present programme expires. </p>
<p>We discussed the size of the programme or better, we discussed the trade-offs between different <span class='uncertainty'>possibilities</span> about length and size and the pros and cons of different scenarios and the transmission channels of that. </p>
<p>The Governing Council has reiterated it 's this fall as the period when these decisions will be taken because the decisions are many, complex and always one naturally sort of thinks about <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> materialise in the coming weeks or months. </p>
<p>The second thing is that we do n't know exactly if any serious <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> materialises which warrants such postponement. </p>
<p>We had a staff projection here that basically <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> downward the inflation rate by some amount based on the appreciation of the euro. </p>
<p>Now, the sense of the discussion we had is that there were <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views about what is the intensity, how much is exogenous, how much is endogenous? </p>
<p>So this angst so far has no evidence that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> justify it. </p>
<p>On the first, you see, there are two sentences in the introductory statement," At the same time, the recent <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the exchange rate represents a source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which requires monitoring with regard to its <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. '' </p>
<p>But there was a general, as I read in the introductory statement, concern that the recent <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in the exchange rate represents a source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which requires monitoring with regard to its <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> implications for the medium-term outlook of price stability. </p>
<p>They, if anything, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be part of our information set that defines our monetary policy. </p>
<p>So I would be sort of <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> about imagining that we coordinate our actions, that we place strategic games in between us. </p>
<p>On your first question, as I said before, there are temporary <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the capital key. </p>
<p>There have been <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span>, there will always be <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the capital key due to the liquidity conditions due to the fact that we 're going to be as market neutral as <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> in our purchases. </p>
<p>So we have to be extremely <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span>. </p>
<p>If the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is the element and the metrics, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> they 've been successful, <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> they 've been judged not to be as so successful. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-10-26</b>, 23 sentences</p></div><p>Growth is growing and momentum is also growing and labour market and everything is doing -- well, I think it 's, I ca n't remember how many quarters of consecutive growth, 17 I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>. </p>
<p>We are looking of course very carefully because it 's different to deal with <span class='uncertainty'>presumably</span> the new NPLs and deal with targets for the whole stock. </p>
<p>When we define a medium-term concept it 's not a fixed time frame ; it really <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on how we are approaching to the achievement of our objective of price stability. </p>
<p>The banks will have to comply or explain and they can explain that they have done the utmost to comply and <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> not do it for understandable reasons. </p>
<p>As far as the first question is concerned, my understanding -- of course I am with you now -- but my understanding is the market reaction was pretty muted to our announcement, to our policy announcement in spite of the fact that it 's a policy announcement of a certain importance, which <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to say that our communication to the market has been pretty effective. </p>
<p>So these accounting rules reinforce very much the treatment of new NPLs, so go in the same direction and can be meaningful, because indeed as I said, <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> lead to a full recognition of losses for the whole life of the asset so -- which means that the new rule also or the new target for the treatment of NPLs can be more or less already accommodated by what will be the imposition of the new accounting rules. </p>
<p>Well, I can <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> some of the things you 're going to see shortly. </p>
<p>So the thing is not adding <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> too much to what the IFRS 9 would impose so -- which means that the targets as they were defined are important, but are at the same time reasonable and in complement with the change in the accounting rules. </p>
<p>So that 's important to ensure that from now on, the banks are careful enough in managing credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> so that there is no further undue accumulation of NPLs. </p>
<p>There is then a target for the formation of provisions when new NPLs would be -- would emerge so that the formation of provisions would have to go up to 100% of the <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> during two years in the case of the <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> are not secured by any collateral, and seven years if they are secured by collateral. </p>
<p>Not only that but it was actually considered to be totally marginal and in fact there were many sort of wrong estimates of what these potential reinvestments <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>They stressed how this number, seven million, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> seven million jobs in the last four years, it actually continues to increase. </p>
<p>It 's not going to stop <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span>, it 's never been our view that things should stop <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span>. </p>
<p>There are big differences from month to month because it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the dates of when the bonds reach maturity. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> add certainly it 's not going to stop <span class='uncertainty'>suddenly</span>. </p>
<p>Reinvestments will take place in the same jurisdiction as principal redemptions with the aim to minimise <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span> from the capital key. </p>
<p>In other words, there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be global factors but we ca n't do anything about that, but we can do a lot about domestic factors. </p>
<p>On the first just let me answer, saying that there were two issues that were not discussed today -- well, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> many others -- but as far as relevant to our today 's decisions, two. </p>
<p>Therefore net purchases per jurisdiction <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>fluctuate</span> owing to the timing of these reinvestments. </p>
<p>So it 's this decision that was taken and so it means of course that with a stronger economy and better management of credit <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, the levels of NPLs for new loans should be way below what they were during the crisis, of course. </p>
<p>But also it 's due to the fact that there is still a large amount of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and therefore prudence has inspired many governors to opt for this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<p>To conclude now that there will be financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> will be premature ; we have to see what 's going to happen. </p>
<p>So as far as any <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> is concerned about the future, we have time until I would say December or even earlier. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2017-12-14</b>, 24 sentences</p></div><p>As a matter of fact, debt -- debt to GDP or debt to value added or debt to assets <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the measure - actually continues to decrease with different intensity <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on the measure. </p>
<p>Certainly it 's not to change monetary policy because of a financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> in a certain part or in a certain market of the eurozone. </p>
<p>The right answer is to have in place macroprudential instruments that are effective, strong and well-targeted to cope with these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>As you know, that has been one of the <span class='uncertainty'>variables</span> we 've been looking more at as one of the drivers of the underlying inflation and therefore one of the drivers for a sustained progress in headline inflation. </p>
<p>We can also safely say that the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of having low inflation in the 0.5%, 0.6% that we 've seen until, what, a year ago has certainly decreased. </p>
<p>It 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> worthwhile spending a word on that. </p>
<p>Frankly, it does n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> likely today. </p>
<p>At the same time, we are not seeing systemically important financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We see the local spots where valuations <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to be overstretched. </p>
<p>We certainly closely monitor the financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> emerge from a situation where we had very, very low interest rates for a long period of time, abundant liquidity for a long period of time. </p>
<p>Actually in a sense it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> even more a remote <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> than it would have been a year ago or even six months ago. </p>
<p>So the ground is fertile for these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Having said that, running such big corporate programmes, it 's not <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> that losses <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be happening. </p>
<p>Certainly we have a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> framework which has served us very, very well since the beginning of the existence of the ECB. </p>
<p>Second, the fiscal policy space is also very limited to cope with <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> downturns and that 's why we are pleading for rebuilding fiscal buffers using the benefits of this economic expansion. </p>
<p>At this point in time, this is something the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of which is very, very small. </p>
<p>But by and large they <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to be factors that will disappear. </p>
<p>So all actions that <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to undermine this credibility are certainly not to be shared or agreed by the ECB and the Governing Council. </p>
<p>So they do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> ultimately on the economic policies. </p>
<p>Whether <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> stop becomes an extension of the programme or becomes tapering, that 's what you want to know ; we have n't discussed that either. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> stop: <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> stop means that we go from 30 to zero? </p>
<p>So we think it 's certainly less <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span>. </p>
<p>The news on inflation remains <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> muted. </p>
<p>As regards the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to the inflation, we can safely say that deflation <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have disappeared. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-01-25</b>, 32 sentences</p></div><p>For example we can all agree about certain things, but we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> disagree about when to move forward. </p>
<p>Now, we have as I said downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relating primarily to geopolitical and especially foreign exchange markets. </p>
<p>By and large, the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth are balanced. </p>
<p>That 's what we are talking about ; some of them are a little more confident <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> because they live in jurisdictions where inflation and developments are a little more encouraging, or the labour market conditions are tighter. </p>
<p>But the first question is that based on data, on today 's data and today 's projection, I think I see very few chances at all that interest rates <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be raised this year. </p>
<p>Going back also to one question: where however we have to be careful is that when -- there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be differences about when to say certain things. </p>
<p>Then you can go back to exactly what I said when you asked and give some <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> to which one of the three is <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the surer to happen. </p>
<p>That design of monetary policy <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well have consequences on the exchange rate, but these will be indirect consequences. </p>
<p>I will answer the second question, but first let me give the floor to the Vice President on the financial stability <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> caused by the negative rates for a long time on lots of assets. </p>
<p>Also it <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on what sort of bargaining strategies the social partners have. </p>
<p>Excuse me, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> you explain me what you meant? </p>
<p>This will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> very much on the conditions of the labour market. </p>
<p>One should not look at monthly purchases because they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> reflect temporary market conditions. </p>
<p>That agreement, subtle as you want, has been in place for decades now whereby policymakers, of course if you do take monetary policy decisions, they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have consequence on the exchange rate on both sides -- on all sides of our monetary policy jurisdictions, and it 's both sides of the ocean but also other countries as well. </p>
<p>The answer to the second question: we are trying -- that 's why what you say is absolutely right ; you have that as a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span>. </p>
<p>By the way, incidentally the Ombudsman also acknowledges that there is no evidence that these meetings <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> have directly influenced or have had an adverse impact on the ECB 's supervisory tasks. </p>
<p>It 's not so, it does n't affect the neutrality of the purchases -- and I 'll tell you the reasons why you observe these <span class='uncertainty'>deviations</span>. </p>
<p>It 's a fact of nature, so the issue is whether these other movements in the exchange rate which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be caused by the use of language that I said is not part of the terms of reference that been agreed recently, whether that has an effect on our inflation path. </p>
<p>These flows can <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> as the design of the programme is flexible and the distribution of actual purchases often <span class='uncertainty'>deviates</span> from the ECB capital key. </p>
<p>In other words, data that do n't change because say the market for a certain commodity all of a <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> changes, supply or demand change. </p>
<p>Moreover, this is particularly relevant for the process of reinvestments, where the amounts to be reinvested are <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> distributed over three months. </p>
<p>So all the ministers and the governors there we recognised that excess <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> or disorderly movements in the exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. </p>
<p>To this extent, we are data <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> and basically, that 's what the data tell us. </p>
<p>On oil price, yes, indeed ; increase in oil prices <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be compensated by appreciation in the euro, although it 's not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations because oil prices have gone up, gone down. </p>
<p>Moreover comparing and finally individual jurisdictions net issuance and the actual purchases in the respective countries <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span>, all other things being equal, that the downward impact of the programme on yields for countries such as Germany should be higher than on other countries. </p>
<p>Now, here we have to distinguish between <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> stop, an extension of the programme and gradual tapering -- and that 's exactly the discussion that we will have. </p>
<p>Of course the largest <span class='uncertainty'>deviation</span> from the ECB 's capital key is Greece due to their ineligibility. </p>
<p>Now, focusing excessively on any particular purchase period, for example on 2017 only, <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> result and yield wrong interpretations. </p>
<p>Others, as you <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> did, there would be a gradual tapering. </p>
<p>But others, later on, there was a comment as far as I 'm concerned this programme <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> actually stop immediately and markets reacted as if that were a serious <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span>. </p>
<p>The time that it takes to pass through is <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> but if you take just the oil price and you translate it in the exchange rate, of course it does compensate that -- which does n't mean by the way that this does n't imply that we sort of accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good thing or a bad thing. </p>
<p>We have observed, however, since December that the expected path of short-term rates, interest rates has moved upward and that the exchange rate <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> has increased. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-03-08</b>, 48 sentences</p></div><p>This is not <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> legally now so it 's an evolution of the system that at present time I judge unsatisfactory and needs to be changed. </p>
<p>Therefore they create reputational and legal liabilities and therefore the supervisor is going to be called in to react to these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> or prevent them from happening. </p>
<p>Also if you read the words, these are really unlikely <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> now, the ones that would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we would activate this easing bias. </p>
<p>I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be willing to answer questions about myself at the date which is closer to the end of my mandate than it is today. </p>
<p>The first time that a reference to stock was made was at the end of 2015 in a press conference I had where there was, I remember, a vast disappointment about the measures that the Governing Council had just decided and I pointed out that even though the measures were <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> not fulfilling your expectations, we still had the stocks that were going to go up over the oncoming period of time. </p>
<p>Basically, our experience from the crisis in the eurozone has shown that sovereign bonds are not riskless: they 're <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> and they are in the banks. </p>
<p>Well, we had several revisions of the growth outlook and at the same time, we have a narrowing of the convergence path, of the <span class='uncertainty'>variance</span> around the path, which basically explains why in a sense we are confident. </p>
<p>Now, on the first point, as a matter of fact the BIS, the Basel Committee was not able to agree on a treatment of the sovereign <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> in the banks ' balance sheets. </p>
<p>Another one is to sort of motivate the business managers to keep vacancies open and <span class='uncertainty'>possibly</span> until the objective is reached. </p>
<p>In fact, flows at the present time matter a lot also because of the sequence that we have in our monetary policy decision that it 's cast in stone whereby the interest rate path <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the dates of the net asset purchases programme. </p>
<p>In this sense, I said before that the decision we took today is obviously using incoming information like, as I said, the reduced <span class='uncertainty'>variance</span>. </p>
<p>This was when I was discussing trade measures, but it applies to all kinds of <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span>. </p>
<p>The point here is basically that we see headline inflation driven often by energy prices, food prices and other components that are more <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span>. </p>
<p>We 've discussed <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> about growth. </p>
<p>There is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the size of slack and this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is more present in some members than in others. </p>
<p>There is <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about potential output growth. </p>
<p>So, what we did was to remove the explicit reference to the <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of an increase in the pace of purchases in the near future. </p>
<p>If we make exception for what 's happening in the United States between market correction, statements, various statements on trade and other issues, you would agree you do n't see much <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> in our financial markets in the eurozone. </p>
<p>What we have seen in the past few cases of elections outcomes does n't <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that markets reacted in a way that would undermine confidence. </p>
<p>It 's just that the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> is different. </p>
<p>If anything, the <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is mostly caused by our own statements. </p>
<p>We are asking the ECJ for a <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> on the present situation. </p>
<p>That 's why we said that the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth are balanced in the sense that we have some upward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> domestically, but some downward <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> globally. </p>
<p>The ones that were <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> 4%, the idea was that then expectations for inflation will adjust and therefore the policy would have to become even more accommodative. </p>
<p>But also there is a fact that strong growth <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> produce stronger potential output growth as well. </p>
<p>At the same time, we want to keep a level playing field across the world with a treatment of similar <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>Of confidence -- because the latest incoming data on growth reduced the <span class='uncertainty'>variance</span> of the path of inflation converging to our inflation aim. </p>
<p>Now, if I <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> elaborate on the second question about Latvia. </p>
<p>If you look at the past structural reforms, the increases in labour supply, the increase in participation rates, the increase in productivity, basically all this increases the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> about the potential output growth path and therefore about the size of the slack in the economy. </p>
<p>The reaction to the Italian elections has been more or less the same as it has been to other elections, to other major political events, where most observers were foreseeing sharp corrections or high <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>. </p>
<p>Well, on the first question, as I said, it was a unanimous decision and there was n't much discussion about other <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> changes in monetary policy for the coming months. </p>
<p>That 's not to underestimate the fact that protracted <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> undermine confidence. </p>
<p>We should n't forget that we have kept the other reference to such a <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> when it says: the Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments for an extended period of time after the end of net asset purchases and in any case for as long as necessary. </p>
<p>There was a <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> repeated reference to the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> surrounding potential output growth path. </p>
<p>Well, I think this was <span class='uncertainty'>suggested</span>, or it was more frequent, about until a year ago. </p>
<p>I would flag this as one major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for the years ahead: that we repeat the same mistake. </p>
<p>The Governing Council has decided, again unanimously, to ask for <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> by the Court of Justice of the European Union whether individual security measures imposed on the Governor of Latvijas Banka by the Latvian Anti-Corruption Authority on 19 February 2018, have had the effect of relieving him from office and they comply with Union law, in particular with Article 14.2 of the Statute. </p>
<p>On the first and we were always -- and it goes back in tradition -- not to discuss <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> about inflation. </p>
<p>Another part was devoted to assessing the progress of -- well, the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> progress we 've made -- about inflation, where we said that basically, inflation, headline inflation, will hover around 1.5% for the remaining part of the year. </p>
<p>More generally, I think there are two main <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> that one can see today. </p>
<p>That 's the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of financial deregulation in other major jurisdictions. </p>
<p>There is also another <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that is less mentioned these days. </p>
<p>This would certainly at the very least introduce higher <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in the future growth path. </p>
<p>These are <span class='uncertainty'>risky</span> assets in banks ' portfolios, so we have to take this into account. </p>
<p>This combination, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> disagree whether the source was predominantly one or the other, but certainly nobody would disagree about the combination of the two. </p>
<p>There is n't any world treatment of sovereign <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span>. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, most countries do n't have any specific <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> weight with respect to that. </p>
<p>It 's quite clear that if we have retaliation, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have effects on confidence that I mentioned before. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-04-26</b>, 35 sentences</p></div><p>They do n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be so far from what we can appreciate now. </p>
<p>Thinking more about the future, as was implicit in your question, I have <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> that on the other hand, one can go back to the simple life of monetary policy as it used to be, with very small central bank balance sheets and just policy targeting the overnight money market rate. </p>
<p>They do n't <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be substantial. </p>
<p>This is why we say there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have acquired more prominence recently. </p>
<p>The answer to the first question: we have to see what the exchange of, so far, rhetoric -- <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> rhetoric -- about protectionism will produce. </p>
<p>If we have an increase in tariffs, increase in protectionism, there <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be direct effects, trade related effects. </p>
<p>Well, the first thing to retain is nevertheless that the set of unconventional instruments that were used are now part of the toolkit of monetary policy to be used if necessary in situations that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> justify again that those instruments would be used. </p>
<p>The answer to your first question is that we did say on a variety of other occasions that we will be reacting to any unwanted or unwarranted tightening of financial conditions that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> affect our medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>Having said that, it 's unquestionable that the decision that leaders took in June 2012 to proceed with the banking union, to create the SSM, to create the Single Resolution Board, to establish the Single Resolution Fund and ESM were all decisions that were addressing evident fragilities -- <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> fragilities -- of the monetary union, and which were made evident by the crisis but were actually pre-existing the crisis. </p>
<p>We mean that we are ready to adapt this ample accommodation to any unwanted tightening of financing conditions that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> alter our medium-term outlook for price stability. </p>
<p>I am not fully sure of that but I think reading, by the way, several academic papers that have been thinking about this, that other instruments <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> become necessary and a broader targeting of other interest rates to ensure an effective transmission of monetary policy. </p>
<p>There are several reasons why a banking union and a capital market union are essential for <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing in the future, without even thinking to fiscal capacity or other forms of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing. </p>
<p>Of course if the bank is not profitable for many years then the solvency issue <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> arise later down the road. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> happen that -- we are people -- so members <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> have problems. </p>
<p>Monetary policy trying to influence only the overnight rate <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> will not be enough. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Perhaps</span> things will have to change a bit for two main reasons. </p>
<p>We 'll have to see, basically, how the growth outlook and therefore how the change in the growth outlook <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> alter what is the convergence of our inflation rate to our objective. </p>
<p>We can look back, and <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> with a little bit more optimism than was implicit in your question, in the sense that we can say that most of the work has been done and that we are on the path to -- as this press conference also indicated in the initial statement in the answers of the President, that everyone feels confident that we are on the way to the normalisation of our objective regarding price stability, and meaning that most of the way has been achieved. </p>
<p>It 's <span class='uncertainty'>apparent</span> that the political decisions that underpin such progress are easier in certain countries than others. </p>
<p>The <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced but, as I said, with more prominence to global <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and I mentioned protectionism. </p>
<p>But there are also other phenomena like for example the drop in backlogs, in manufacturing and capital goods sectors that would -- <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a softening in demand and therefore warrant monitoring by the Governing Council. </p>
<p>There are several temporary factors which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have produced this <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> size. </p>
<p>But such convergence remains <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on an ample degree of monetary accommodation. </p>
<p>Clearly there is some <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span> component, as I was saying, which is mostly due to temporary factors like the -- especially in one country it 's cold weather, it 's the strikes, it 's the timing of Easter. </p>
<p>There are certain encouraging signs on nominal wage growth where we start seeing some movements which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> support price pressures in the coming months. </p>
<p>Then we discussed the <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> causes of this or how to read through -- to read this normalisation. </p>
<p>And these declines were sharp and in some cases, the extent of these declines was <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<p>Of course when we leave with a sense of the work <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> done in that respect and that monetary policy, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> hopefully in the next few years, will not be as exciting as it has been during the years I spent in the Board. </p>
<p>It actually does n't necessarily <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> any overshooting of inflation ; it 's in a sense two different things, really. </p>
<p>We all know that these external shocks <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> indeed happen. </p>
<p>I mentioned before caution and I mentioned some developments that the changes in these indicators - that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a more durable softening in demand. </p>
<p>It simply would <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there is more room for keeping the ample monetary accommodation in place, be it based on assets or be it based on keeping low rates for a longer period of time while at the same time if it were the case of a durable increase in potential output growth, well, at the same time the neutral rate would be higher. </p>
<p>Sharp declines were experienced by PMI, <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all sectors, in retail, sales, manufacturing, services, in construction. </p>
<p>Now, on your first question you 're right ; the exchange rate stabilised and recent <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> is less. </p>
<p>Now, the first question <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggests</span> that I report on the exchanges we had today because this would explain the answer to your question. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-06-14</b>, 41 sentences</p></div><p>Basically, it 's a pullback from the very high levels of growth in 2017, mostly justified by an extraordinary pickup in exports, which is unlikely to repeat itself now, compounded by an increase -- an undeniable increase in <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> - and for a variety of reasons really, mostly geopolitical reasons, and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and the global level as well as weaker impetus from external trade. </p>
<p>The assessment that the Governing Council gave of the current economic environment, of the underlying strength of the economy, while being overall appropriate for achieving the decisions that were taken today, does n't want to underplay the existing <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>By the way, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well have this soft patch being <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> longer than it is in the staff projections. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> easily converge on a set of decisions that, as I said, had unanimity. </p>
<p>At some point, we say that so far, because we have an unquestionable increase in the geopolitical global <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>, we <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> also have some increase in the -- but less so -- in the domestic <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>First of all, on forward guidance: the decision was unanimous about its date and state <span class='uncertainty'>dependency</span>. </p>
<p>In some countries, for example, it is foreseen that it <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> extend into the second quarter, but this at the same time does n't tell that the underlying strength is n't changed. </p>
<p>Well, to say that we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> -- because that 's what we say -- a series of actions, means that based on the current assessment, we are taking these actions. </p>
<p>Here <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> the lesson that we can draw is that in order to have a level playing field, we have to make progress in terms of consistency and coherence among different countries with respect to insolvency regulation. </p>
<p>Well, on the first question, the rates will be changed <span class='uncertainty'>depending</span> on what is the state of the convergence process. </p>
<p>We see increasing <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>As far as whether a specific <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have an impact, we 've seen some <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span>, then it has receded. </p>
<p>The third part where it comes in is when we say that we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that after September 2018, it 's subject to incoming data, confirming our medium-term inflation outlook. </p>
<p>One of which is that it 's both state <span class='uncertainty'>contingent</span> ; in other words, we have to look at the general situation of the convergence process and its state. </p>
<p>It 's the effect of general confidence, that a round of measures and retaliations <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> produce on the world economy. </p>
<p>As I said at the beginning, it also shows the general <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that has increased over the previous weeks. </p>
<p>I think that now the authorities have given the go-ahead to this <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> and it 's going on. </p>
<p>I think in another press conference I stressed an effect which is in a sense harder to quantify, but it 's <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> the most important one. </p>
<p>First of all, one should n't get obsessed about weekly figures of flows because one is bound to get <span class='uncertainty'>confused</span>, the first remark. </p>
<p>For two reasons, given the present economic situation, but also we always have to remember that the continuing convergence is <span class='uncertainty'>conditional</span> on interest rates remaining ; on reinvestment for an extended period of time ; on all the other decisions we have taken. </p>
<p>That 's the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, I 'd say. </p>
<p>It 's a new instrument of monetary policy that will be used for <span class='uncertainty'>contingencies</span> that we do n't see now, and that 's what we <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span>. </p>
<p>So we have this forward guidance on interest rates which is both state and date <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span>. </p>
<p>As I said at the very beginning, it tells that this decision has been taken in the presence of a strong economy with increasing <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>Certainly there is the collective intention of the Governing Council members to avoid any tightening of excess liquidity conditions or any unwanted tightening of monetary and financing conditions that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> spur from the reinvestment. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be that different views from before are being expressed. </p>
<p>Now, on your first point, yes, we 've seen a significant rise in sovereign yields on the back of political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> around the end of May. </p>
<p>Now we have several new safeguards against redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, so I do n't think this discussion was meaningful today. </p>
<p>That 's very important, because again if we go back two, three years ago we would see that there was a serious <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of, what we call de-anchoring of inflation expectations. </p>
<p>We have n't seen really any redenomination of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>Contagion was not significant, if any, if at all, so it was a pretty local episode and so we have n't seen the redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>. </p>
<p>That 's actually always said ; that that was the key <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> we would look at for convergence of inflation. </p>
<p>Now, the information that we have is that one of the alternatives of the Latvian law on insolvency is the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of self-liquidation. </p>
<p>Fourth -- and it 's very important -- the tail <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation, have disappeared. </p>
<p>At this point in time, we <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> there was enough to communicate for just one meeting and we will cope with this later on. </p>
<p>Now, about <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>We 've taken these decisions knowing that the economy is in a better situation with an increase in <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> and at the same time, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> because of information that came after the cut-off date, <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> in some countries this soft patch, as I said before, will continue in Q2 while the projections have <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> Q1, but have kept unchanged the Q2, Q3 and Q4 for this year. </p>
<p>In other words, while we were talking quite frequently about three years ago about surrounding <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> of our projections, now it 's disappeared. </p>
<p>There was a discussion, if we go back in 2011 and ' 12, about redenomination <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> but the situation was entirely different. </p>
<p>It <span class='uncertainty'>appears</span> that it 's self-sustained, as you can see from today 's decision and the reactions to the decision. </p>
<p>Now, of course the second question I will not answer given what 's been said at the beginning ; that I am not taking questions on a court case that 's <span class='uncertainty'>pending</span>. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-07-26</b>, 20 sentences</p></div><p>Frankly, we have n't done this analysis yet but we do see growth rates stabilising at this level, which is actually pretty good for the eurozone after this <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> performance in exports. </p>
<p>I think it 's just too early to understand exactly what part of the liabilities do reflect political <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>As I think I said last time, as far as pure expectations are concerned, they are very well aligned with the <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span> of the Governing Council that policy rates will remain at their current levels through the summer of next year. </p>
<p>Let me now address the first part of the question about whether we can see an impact coming from higher nominal wage growth that <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> compensate trade. </p>
<p>What we see is that this component now <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have increased since our June announcement due to various factors, including the state of the debate on trade. </p>
<p>Overall the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to growth have been assessed as still broadly balanced. </p>
<p>As such it does n't generate <span class='uncertainty'>instability</span>. </p>
<p>Now, as you 've seen, the term structure of money market rates reflects the -- it reflects two things ; reflects the pure expectations of the future path of the policy rates, but reflects also the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that surrounds the evolution of the economy. </p>
<p>We do n't want to exclude the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that they <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> happen. </p>
<p>Then you have the <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> component in the term structure ; this of course <span class='uncertainty'>tends</span> to be more <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span> and shifts with <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> perceptions. </p>
<p>In this sense you see that the accounting and settlement of the balances do <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on where the settlement is made. </p>
<p>But I would say <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> all indicators have now stabilised at levels that are above historical averages. </p>
<p>There is an international consensus that has been going on now for years -- for decades, <span class='uncertainty'>perhaps</span> -- about abstaining from competitive devaluations, so that 's the answer. </p>
<p>Now, this enhanced forward guidance has been very effective, as broadly reflected in surveys, market commentary and market prices, in aligning expectations of the future rate path with the <span class='uncertainty'>anticipations</span> of the Governing Council. </p>
<p>Some other events <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well not be foreseeable at the present time. </p>
<p><span class='uncertainty'>Maybe</span> in the perverse minds of some market players <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> -- this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be true, but certainly not in the Governing Council members ' minds. </p>
<p>The first point is that it 's now clearer than it was before that the moderation in growth -- and here I am addressing your first question -- <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> essentially on the pullback from the <span class='uncertainty'>unusually</span> strong growth rates that we 've seen in the first -- the last three-quarters last year, which were caused by -- predominantly by an <span class='uncertainty'>unusually</span> strong export performance. </p>
<p>Certainly, just to make it clear, the capital key remains our anchor in what we do on reinvestments, just to clear the slate from any <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>We would have to assess both the direct effects, which <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be significant as the numbers significantly go up, and the indirect effects of confidence on -- especially on business investment. </p>
<p>Most of the movement in TARGET2 liabilities <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on our own asset purchase programme and <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on how and where -- especially where -- the balances of the purchases of bonds are settled. </p>
<br></br> <div class='section'> <p><b>2018-09-13</b>, 35 sentences</p></div><p>About the emerging market countries, exchange rate effects on the euro area, we briefly touched on that in one specific context, when we say that the foreign demand is weaker for the euro area, and this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be due to the stronger exchange rate of the euro, we have to keep in mind that the depreciation of the Turkish lira actually accounts for much of that effect. </p>
<p>That <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well be not because of external factors but because of endogenous facts that we have n't seen yet really. </p>
<p>The answer to the first question, the question is ; was the assessment that <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are broadly balanced shared by all Governing Council members? </p>
<p>Namely we had quite <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> strong growth last year based also on a pretty strong <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> export performance. </p>
<p>There are dangers that its effects <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> wane in 2020, so the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> there is of an increase in interest rates accompanied by a weakening of economic activity. </p>
<p>I 'm sorry, both questions <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be in principle very interesting questions but we have n't discussed that. </p>
<p>Even though they have tightened <span class='uncertainty'>somewhat</span> since the last meeting, the lending conditions to firms and households remain very favourable. </p>
<p>But the same <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be said about non-financial corporations. </p>
<p>So we ca n't say much about the future of Euribor because that <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> very much on the administrator of Euribor and on the regulators ; namely ESMA and FSMA. </p>
<p>Well, the answer to the first question is no, we have n't changed the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> about growth. </p>
<p>An employment situation which is by and large improving <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> everywhere, some countries more than others. </p>
<p>That 's one, but the other much more important consideration is that we are observing an underlying strength of the economy that makes us think that the downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are going to be mitigated by this fact, by the -- as I mentioned before - improvement in the labour market and the rise in wages, which are the main drivers that support consumption. </p>
<p>Fiscal policies in several euro area countries are going to be <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> less neutral than we had expected some time ago. </p>
<p>There are also upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, one of which is the fiscal policies. </p>
<p>Also liquidity management, morale, <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> management, governance have all been overhauled by the legislators, by the regulators and by the supervisors. </p>
<p>Still when you look forward, you certainly have countries where growth is more buoyant, countries where growth <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be less buoyant and downward revisions <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be more significant. </p>
<p>In other jurisdictions we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> sort of fear a backtracking to a world where there is less regulation. </p>
<p>We do n't carry the same <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> analysis for inflation as we do with growth. </p>
<p>I 've listed just a series of downside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>. </p>
<p>This is one potential <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of enhanced financial <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> and we 're also monitoring that. </p>
<p>Clearly, there we have to look at basically three factors that <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> make this <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> more severe. </p>
<p>That is the major source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> which, by the way, is reflected in the current macroeconomic projections only to the extent of the measures that have been implemented already. </p>
<p>On the second question, well, this answer <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> be very long. </p>
<p>Now, I think I listed three sources of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>. </p>
<p>Now, of course we can have individual situations of significant <span class='uncertainty'>exposure</span> to local crises. </p>
<p>I think what I said last time -- and I can confirm that even though we have n't discussed, I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> the Governing Council would be pretty unanimous on that -- is that the capital key will remain the guiding principle. </p>
<p>Certainly the major source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> that we see in global output comes from the rising protectionism. </p>
<p>The ever-improving conditions of the labour market - we 'll <span class='uncertainty'>maybe</span> elaborate on that. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. </p>
<p>The second source of <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> is indeed the potential -- we have n't seen much of it yet but it 's one of the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> we 're looking at, we are certainly monitoring -- the potential financial market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> generated by changes -- gradual, at measured pace as you know -- changes in monetary policy in the main jurisdictions. </p>
<p>Well, considering the first questions, the increased <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainties</span> in some emerging markets is certainly one factor that adds to the general <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> in world markets. </p>
<p>So the balance of <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> has n't changed. </p>
<p>But we have to say that really in the aggregate, what 's happening in Argentina and Turkey so far does n't show any significant spillover, although at a level of individual institutions one <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> well see significant <span class='uncertainty'>exposures</span> to local realities. </p>
<p>But this <span class='uncertainty'>assumes</span> that lower growth translates immediately into lower inflation in the long term. </p>
<p>At the same time, <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market <span class='uncertainty'>volatility</span> have gained more prominence recently. </p>
