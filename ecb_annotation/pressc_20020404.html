<h2>Introductory statement</h2>
<p class='N'>As usual, we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments.  The Governing Council concluded that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term and, accordingly, decided to leave them unchanged.  </p>
<p class='N'>Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 stood at 7.8% in the period from December 2001 to February 2002, compared with 8.0% in the period from November 2001 to January 2002.  The high level of the annual growth rates of M3 continues to reflect the past portfolio shifts to liquid positions.  These shifts primarily occurred during autumn 2001, when the economic and financial environment was characterised by high <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span>.  However, in the meantime, some normalisation in the development of M3 has taken place.  This is indicated by a significant slowdown in the short-term dynamics of M3 in early 2002, a period in which the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector has also continued to decline.  However, the period of moderation in monetary growth has as yet been too short to allow a definitive assessment.  </p>
<p class='N'>Against this background, the Governing Council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar does not thus far point to <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability.  Nevertheless, the persistence of excess liquidity in the economy <span class='weak'>could</span> become a concern once the economic recovery in the euro area gathers pace.  </p>
<p class='N'>As regards the second pillar, the trough in economic activity was in all <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> reached at the end of last year.  Further information received over the past few weeks, i.e. surveys, financial market and leading indicators, strengthened the expectations of a recovery in the course of this year.  While some <span class='uncertainty'>uncertainty</span> remains as regards the precise pattern of the recovery, not least in the context of a substantial increase in oil prices, the latest evidence has reinforced our previous assessment.  Real GDP growth rates in the euro area <span class='moderate'>should</span> again be in line with potential growth later this year.  Domestic factors support the recovery.  First, a reversal of the past inventory drawdown is under way and real disposable income growth is expected to benefit from lower rates of inflation.  Second, financing conditions are favourable.  We also expect the stronger international environment to play an important role in stimulating euro area exports, and both domestic and external factors <span class='moderate'>should</span> foster investment.  Finally, the positive outlook for the euro area economy is very much supported by sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances.  </p>
<p class='N'>Turning to price developments, let me first recall that, over recent months, annual rates of consumer price inflation have been affected by several factors of a special or temporary nature.  This <span class='uncertainty'>volatile</span> pattern was broadly <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>.  However, annual inflation rates are currently <span class='weak'>somewhat</span> higher than was expected a few months ago, with early estimates for March pointing to a figure of 2.5%.  This is mainly because oil prices have again risen significantly in the more recent period.  If sustained, higher oil prices <span class='moderate'>would</span> also have an impact on inflation rates in the remainder of 2002.  While inflation rates are expected to fall to below 2% later in the coming months, this decline <span class='weak'>may</span> <span class='weak'>possibly</span> be less pronounced than was foreseen, and inflation rates during this year <span class='weak'>could</span> turn out to be <span class='weak'>somewhat</span> higher than previously expected.  </p>
<p class='N'>Beyond the shorter term, upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand <span class='moderate'>should</span>, in the light of current projections of a gradual economic recovery in the euro area, remain contained.  In addition, the outlook for inflation is fundamentally <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on wage moderation.  Such moderation is important not only in order to contain <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability but also to foster employment growth.  As I have already noted on earlier occasions, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations.  </p>
<p class='N'>Fiscal policies in the euro area <span class='moderate'>can</span> also contribute to the maintenance of a favourable outlook for non-inflationary growth.  It is vital that the commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 2003-04 be firmly followed up in the Member States concerned.  A continuation along the path of fiscal consolidation is essential, as is vigilance in ensuring strict adherence to the medium-term plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact.  </p>
<p class='N'>Equally, the expected recovery <span class='moderate'>should</span> be seen as an ideal opportunity to strengthen efforts towards implementing comprehensive structural reforms -- in public expenditure and revenues and product, labour and financial markets.  Heads of State and Government confirmed this objective during their recent meeting in Barcelona.  If implemented vigorously, such reforms <span class='weak'>could</span> increase the growth of real GDP and employment on a sustainable basis.  Past improvements in the functioning of markets, together with wage moderation, have contributed to strong employment growth and a considerable reduction in unemployment.  It is therefore clearly in the interest of all countries to continue to rigorously implement the agenda agreed in Lisbon and recently confirmed in Barcelona.  </p>
<h2>Questions and answers</h2>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: From what you have just said about oil prices and the rest of your introductory statement, <span class='moderate'>can</span> you still say that you are confident that, on average, inflation will be below 2% this year and, if it is not, what are the wider credibility issues involved?  Is there one for the European Central Bank?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: We still think that inflation will fall to below 2% later this year, i.e. in the coming months, and, on average, we still think and are confident that it will be below but close to 2%.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. President, the recovery again <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to be quite export-led.  So, consumer confidence has not strengthened very much.  Is there a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that the audiences see the ECB as being too busy, too hawkish, to raise rates?  And, when we look at the market expectations, they are expecting quite early interest rate rises.  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: Well, consumer confidence remained broadly unchanged in March, while it has increased slightly in the first quarter of 2002 as a whole.  And now, the more subdued behaviour of consumer confidence, as compared with industrial confidence, is in line with similar developments at other turning points in the cycle.  Therefore, to answer your question quite frankly, we do not think that a recovery in the euro area will be predominantly export-led.  It will be predominantly domestic demand that will lead it.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. President, two points.  First, on what you refer to at the end of your statement.  Do you consider as compelling for the Member States of the euro zone, for example France, the commitment agreed among the Finance Ministers to balance the budget at the latest in the year 2004...  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: Yes.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>:... and I <span class='moderate'>would</span> add to that: do you think, like some, that measures to achieve these 2004 goals <span class='weak'>could</span> be avoided if they contradict the current economic impulse, if they have a negative impact for the euro zone Member States ' economies right now, that these Member States <span class='weak'>could</span> postpone this goal?  And the second point was: do you consider the reform of protection against lay-offs in the labour market in the euro zone, as planned in many Member States like Italy and as mentioned in Germany, an again compellingly necessary step to achieve this reform of the labour markets?  Thank you.  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: I do think that adhering to the goals set in the Stability and Growth Pact will enhance confidence amongst the public that governments are keeping to their plans and will, thereby, increase the credibility of economic policies as such.  And the measures on the labour market that are being contemplated in various countries <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> very much from country to country, but I do think it is very much of interest to restructure the functioning of the labour markets, in particular in the countries you have mentioned.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Duisenberg, have you made any assessment of the potential <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to the economic recovery as a result of the higher oil prices?  Are there any concerns that the rebound in growth <span class='weak'>may</span> be delayed or weaker than you <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>, especially since you expect the recovery to be led by domestic demand?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: If the recent rise in oil prices, which has been significant, persists or even continues to rise, there will obviously be <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to both inflation and output developments.  But it is a big" if ''.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Duisenberg, how does the ECB characterise the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability today and, as regards the month of May, is that still the month that inflation will go below 2%?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: I hope it is.  I said" later, in the coming months ''.  Well, May is one of the coming months.  How do I assess the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> to price stability?  The conclusion: that we regard the current monetary policy stance as appropriate, to my mind, speaks for itself.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. President, has the Governing Council talked about the crisis in the Middle East and what sort of dangers are arising down there?  Talking about oil prices again, are there also other kinds of slowdown for the world economy and <span class='weak'>maybe</span> the European economy?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: We have not.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Duisenberg, in Germany people call the euro" Teuro '' because we have a lot of higher prices, especially in the service sector.  Do you agree with that view and is there a <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to consumer confidence because people <span class='moderate'>tend</span> to be <span class='uncertainty'>cautious</span> when they see the euro prices and especially in the service sector you <span class='moderate'>can</span> see some euro prices as high as Deutsche Mark prices were before?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: As far as we <span class='moderate'>can</span> measure, the impact of the cash changeover to the new currency has only had a very limited impact on the overall price index on a very broad basket of prices of goods.  Now, it is true that in some sectors, particularly the ones you mentioned, services, larger price increases have been observed and if you look at, in particular, the goods that are -- let me say -- closest to the hearts and the wallets of the population, i.e. the cost of a haircut or going to a restaurant, then you notice it.  That <span class='weak'>may</span> cause some -- let me call it --" bias '' in the judgement of the people, and I do hope that that effect will fade away sooner rather than later.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Duisenberg, markets <span class='uncertainty'>seemed</span> to expect that interest rates <span class='weak'>may</span> rise by as much as 1 full percentage point by the end of the year.  <span class='moderate'>Would</span> you say that it is a realistic expectation or are they <span class='uncertainty'>anticipating</span> too much?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: What I said about the current monetary policy stance <span class='moderate'>should</span> be enough.  It is appropriate and I do not want to engage in any <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about future moves.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: The ECB 's Chief Economist said there were no price <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> on the immediate horizon, but that, if there were, they <span class='moderate'>would</span> be on the upside.  How quickly are these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> approaching and what <span class='moderate'>would</span> the main source of these <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> be?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: We do not know.  I agree with the statement that if there are <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> they are mainly on the upside.  To what extent and how quickly they <span class='moderate'>would</span> emerge or materialise is totally <span class='weak'>uncertain</span>.  It is too early to tell.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: I have two questions.  Mr. Duisenberg, <span class='moderate'>would</span> it be a problem for the European Central Bank to have missed the stability target of below 2% for two consecutive years and this year as well because of the oil price and other aspects?  Second question.  I <span class='moderate'>would</span> like to refer to the informal ECOFIN Council, which is meeting in Oviedo.  In your meeting in the Council today, did you talk about <span class='weak'>possible</span> candidates that you <span class='weak'>might</span> have to choose?  Do you think the successor of Mr. Christian Noyer will be appointed in Oviedo?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: I do not want to <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> again about the <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> that inflation on average <span class='weak'>might</span> turn out higher than 2%.  As I already said in answer to an earlier question, we are confident that we will be below but close to 2% on average this year.  And as far as the succession of my distinguished colleague here is concerned, I refrain, also there, from <span class='uncertainty'>speculating</span>.  I expect a proposal <span class='weak'>maybe</span> in Oviedo or shortly thereafter.  And you will understand that the right of initiative is this time fully with the Ministers of Finance.  Our judgement will come at a later stage.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: I have two questions.  First, what do you think about Mr. Welteke 's proposal to sell part of the gold reserves of the Deutsche Bundesbank and buy some stocks instead?  <span class='weak'>Could</span> this measure also be adopted by other national central banks?  And the second question is about the Italian government.  Yesterday, the Italian minister, Giulio Tremonti, said that the deficit-GDP ratio <span class='moderate'>would</span> be higher than expected in 2002, namely 0.7% instead of 0.5%.  What is your view on this?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: To take the last question first.  The Italian government is one of the twelve that have committed themselves to reaching the goals set in the Stability and Growth Pact by 2003 and 2004.  So, what the deficit in 2002 will turn out to be is not out of line with that intention.  As far as the statement by President Welteke is concerned, I <span class='moderate'>would</span> like to remind you that he has declared that the Bundesbank <span class='weak'>may</span> sell some of its gold stocks over the medium to long term.  However, the Bundesbank is also a signatory to the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which expires only in September 2004.  Thus, his statement only refers to the period after that.  And then I am sure that the Bundesbank, as all signatory central banks are doing, will act in a very responsible manner.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Mr. Duisenberg, Mr. Welteke has also proposed that the Deutsche Bundesbank use some of the money from the sale of gold stocks to buy equities.  Do you have any objections to that idea, or are there any objections from the European Central Bank against this in terms of jurisdiction?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: Well, the management of both the foreign reserves and the domestic assets of any national central bank falls, beyond certain thresholds, under the guidelines and guidance of the ECB.  That is one thing.  And to buy equities is, let me put it this way, for many central banks not <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>.  </p>
<p class='Q'><strong>Question</strong>: Is it your expectation that when the successor to your colleague, Mr. Noyer, is announced, there will also be an announcement concerning the successor to Ms Hämäläinen?  </p>
<p class='A'><strong>Duisenberg</strong>: I do not expect that.  The succession of Ms Hämäläinen and -- <span class='weak'>may</span> I add -- of myself is not yet on the agenda.  That is not a short-term problem.  I expect that to be dealt with in the first half of next year.  </p>
