<h1>List of sentences containing uncertainty words in the answer section, by negations</h1>
</div>
<br></br>
<body>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'any (28)'}</b></div><p>On the capital relief, it very much will <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the regulatory treatment and also on the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> retention, because we certainly want the intermediaries to retain some <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span>, because we learned painfully, I would say, from the crisis, how, all in all inadvisable it is not to have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> retention by the intermediaries. </p>
<p>As regards the alertness of the ECB, I think that nobody has <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about our alertness. </p>
<p>The whole plan will be implemented in an orderly fashion without creating <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span> in Greece as a result of this process. </p>
<p>On the other hand, all the indications we have given - and I will repeat them again today - are such that I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that there can not be <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anybody 's mind as to the direction in which the next move will go. </p>
<p>I do not yet see <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of exuberance because, after all, we are now back in a normal situation, from a financial viewpoint, but we are not at all seeing an early or strong recovery. </p>
<p>I do not think that there is <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in the minds of observers, market participants, investors and households that we would be fully capable of doing that. </p>
<p>So there should n't be <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that, and we have plenty of instruments, as you know. </p>
<p>So one should n't have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the Governing Council in its collective wisdom not only has the power, the willingness and the determination, but also the cohesion that 's necessary to take the actions that are needed. </p>
<p>Not because there is <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> consequence, but because we have the technical knowledge and habit of doing this with the help of all the national central banks of the Eurosystem. </p>
<p>But it does not point to <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of such a development in the short term. </p>
<p>That is why I say that there can not be <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anybody 's mind as to the direction of future monetary policy. </p>
<p>Well, I do not think that my statement of today - as I have said before - can leave <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about what we have been doing. </p>
<p>That 's the most important thing that we can do today, to preserve the solvency and the robustness of the Greek banking system, and also to this extent, the ECB has asked the Eurogroup members to make sure that the recapitalisation fund of something around $ 10 billion be readily available to face <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>sudden</span> negative <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> that <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> materialise. </p>
<p>It 's quite interesting that until a month ago, nobody had <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that public debt, sovereign debt in the euro area, was actually very, very big, and now some people worry that we wo n't have enough bonds. </p>
<p>To the extent that what is at stake is the position of the ECB itself and if there is <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> on the ECB position, yes, you got it perfectly right. </p>
<p>So these are the facts, and <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> concerning <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> choices is unfounded because decisions have not yet been taken and the <span class='uncertainty'>revised</span> plans have not yet been assessed. </p>
<p>That does not have any impact on <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> increase in MRO rates down the road, in particular three years from now. </p>
<p>I would exclude completely -- you did n't say that, but you <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> have thought about this in your mind -- I would exclude completely <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possibility</span> of monetary financing. </p>
<p>On the question of bubbles, one of the reasons for taking the decision that we have taken today is that we do not really see <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> for inflation expectations, on either side, certainly not on the upside in the short or medium term. </p>
<p>Well, I 'll quickly and readily answer the second question immediately, saying that I do n't even want to contemplate that, and based on the Greek government leaders ' statements, this option is not contemplated by themselves as well, so I 'm not ready to discuss <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> situation like that. </p>
<p>So that 's why there should n't be <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about doing structural reforms. </p>
<p>Certainly, just to make it clear, the capital key remains our anchor in what we do on reinvestments, just to clear the slate from <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>So as far as <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>clarification</span> is concerned about the future, we have time until I would say December or even earlier. </p>
<p>It is appropriate and I do not want to engage in <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about future moves. </p>
<p>So, I will refrain from <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> - also on this aspect. </p>
<p>I will not enter into <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculation</span> about who will be my successor, as you can understand and as you undoubtedly <span class='uncertainty'>anticipated</span>. </p>
<p>If you have <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about that, you also have the IMF team who was in Italy for a financial sector assessment. </p>
<p>So, I agree with you that separation is essential, but frankly I do n't agree with you about MPS and the future SSM being linked in <span class='negation'>any</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> way other than me being former governor of Banca d'Italia and now being president of the ECB. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'never (2)'}</b></div><p>Yes, I <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> your investigative capacities. </p>
<p>I will also say again that you should <span class='negation'>never</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the role of the supervisory authority with the involvement, when unfortunately necessary, of the Treasury. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'no (60)'}</b></div><p>But fundamentally the answer to your implicit question as to how to deal with the <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of underbidding lies with the whole framework that we have designed: we have this corridor with the deposit facility on one side and, in this case more importantly, the overdraft facility on the other side, so that there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that the banking sector will be short of cash. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some profound changes are taking place in the world energy markets and you know which ones I am thinking about. </p>
<p>So, to conclude, I would ask the IMF to do its very important job, and I am in <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that it will continue to do the job very well. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>: we issue the currency and I sign the banknotes. </p>
<p>But some German figures are clearly a good sign, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<p>It is a stimulative monetary policy -- there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>We always consider <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, but there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> of inaction. </p>
<p>That does not mean that there were <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differing</span> views. </p>
<p>But there will be <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>turbulences</span> and no surprises with the implementation of this plan. </p>
<p>As I just said in the introductory statement, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that low growth is the outcome of economies that need to have structural reforms, both in the product and the labour markets, but also in many other sectors, such as education and the judiciary. </p>
<p>There is absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that it is much easier to adjust if you have inflation of 2% than if you have an inflation of 0% because of the rigidity of prices and wages, the downward rigidity of nominal prices and wages. </p>
<p>It is thoroughly imprudent to create <span class='uncertainty'>contingency</span> plans where we see <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> of such events happening. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>So there 's <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that there are, sort of, quite sizeable flows now that are the main reason for this buoyant market. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that, it <span class='uncertainty'>seems</span> to me, in the perception of observers and market participants. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confusion</span> on this point. </p>
<p>But there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that conditions in the financial markets have been gradually easing since July 2012. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in the mind of any market participant, observer, investor and saver that we will act and do what is necessary when it is necessary. </p>
<p>No, we also see <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> of deflation emerging. </p>
<p>But when we look at the consequences, the impact that our monetary policy measures had on financial markets, I think there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that they 've been highly effective. </p>
<p>I have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>This does not mean that we have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, we have <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> and those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are clearly on the downside. </p>
<p>And I 'll just sum it up on behalf of the Governing Council: we are looking at inflation in the medium term, price stability in the medium term, and we see at the moment I am speaking <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> for a destabilisation of our prices. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that these measures, like the TLTROs and the ABS and the covered bond programme, will unfold over a certain horizon, and we have done a lot of things since June. </p>
<p>It is certainly our collective duty to explain better, but there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we all agree on the direction to be taken. </p>
<p>Well, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that if you look at the world today, you see the geopolitical <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> have increased all over the world. </p>
<p>The unemployment rate is at the lowest since May 2009, though it 's still at 9.5%, and this <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> tell something about the need to do structural reforms, because there 's <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some of this unemployment is structural and not cyclical. </p>
<p>But having said that, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that inflation is low and will remain low. </p>
<p>As regards the bank lending survey, we have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipation</span> of what we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see in the future. </p>
<p>However, I would say that there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that some of the stressed countries are actually making very significant progress in terms of fiscal consolidation. </p>
<p>I am confident that there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>likelihood</span> at all that the same exercise is going to be repeated in the future. </p>
<p>On the first question: there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that by expanding the collateral eligibility rules, as we have done to increase access to the 3-year LTRO to a much larger variety of banks, we are also expanding the potential <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> that we are taking onto our balance sheet. </p>
<p>For the other countries, the countries that now are having deflation, the key question -- there 's <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that this sort of negative growth in prices <span class='uncertainty'>depends</span> on the lack of demand, but also on relative price adjustment. </p>
<p>As I have said already to the extent that our scenario is confirmed, it is clear that further withdrawals of monetary accommodation will be warranted, and there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>However, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we can see the effect of supply and demand and the encountering of supply and demand, as well as the effect of fairly high levels of cartelisation in the various markets. </p>
<p>There is absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we must be faithful to our mandate, and our mandate is clear. </p>
<p>And that there is absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span>, we are in a posture of strong vigilance. </p>
<p>Well, let me say this: on the basis of the statement I have just made, there can be <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> in anyone 's mind as to the direction in which monetary policy will be moving in the near future. </p>
<p>It will be denominated in euro, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>But we think that it was exactly what we had to do and there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>And I think that your colleagues have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about what I have said. </p>
<p>So what has been done is appropriate, we have <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> about that, and it has given full credibility to the programme that had already been decided upon, but which, prior to these decisions, was lacking credibility. </p>
<p>For us, for the European Commission, for the peers, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>As regards the United States, of course I am happy that a solution has been found, and I had <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that a solution would be found. </p>
<p>That is absolutely obvious and was seen by all observers, <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>So, where monetary policy is at stake, there is absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span>. </p>
<p>I also refer to the statement of the Minister of Finance, who knows the available data and who recently stated that there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the country fulfilled at the time the criteria. </p>
<p>But that does not mean, obviously, that there are <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span>, and that those <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> are not of great importance. </p>
<p>So I have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that, all things being measured appropriately, Greece is in a much better state today, taking into account its activity and output, than it was before. </p>
<p>I have told you that <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing or <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> sharing was not a fundamental aspect of the effect, of the effectiveness of our monetary policy measures today, while it is a fundamental component of our OMT programme. </p>
<p>As of cyclical factors,, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the labour market in general is experiencing the combined effects of a credit crunch and the unavoidable fiscal consolidation that many of these countries have had to undertake. </p>
<p>So <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubts</span> whatsoever about the effectiveness of our monetary policy, regardless of whether structural reforms have been implemented or not. </p>
<p>It is as simple as that, there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>ambiguity</span> regarding our own monetary policy concept. </p>
<p>But as I said, we have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that the action will be taken and will be as speedy and transparent as the other European countries and as the markets themselves require it to be. </p>
<p>And I have reason to <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span>, I <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> say from the highest sources, that there can be <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that France, as a full member of the euro area and the European Union, will live up to its commitments which it took upon itself when establishing the Stability and Growth Pact at the Summit in Dublin. </p>
<p>So, <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> about that. </p>
<p>And there is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that significant progress has been made in terms of fiscal consolidation throughout the entire euro area. </p>
<p>This is clear, and if you look at the market participants, observers, investors, savers the world over, they have absolutely <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> that we are independent. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> anywhere that we are and will remain faithful to our mandate. </p>
<p>There is <span class='negation'>no</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span>. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'not (111)'}</b></div><p>It does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me that our reputation is that we are behind the curve, at least when I read various articles. </p>
<p>That being said I would also draw your attention to an argument which I see from time to time and which does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me to be appropriate. </p>
<p>And I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> it is wise to make unconditional statements about the future. </p>
<p>And the increase in long-term yields -- which by the way is a very recent one -- does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have had any visible effects. </p>
<p>As regards your third question on structural reforms, again, I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> the next meeting and meetings of the Eurogroup. </p>
<p>And as such, I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> - although I can not comment further on forecasts which still have to be released - I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that they are already now too optimistic. </p>
<p>So we do not expect and do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that the conversion itself will have a significant impact on inflation. </p>
<p>I can not answer that question, but I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in" complots ''. </p>
<p>So the liquidity conditions and the financing conditions for private agents do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be tight or to have any consequences for economic developments. </p>
<p>When we look at the precise figure, I think we have signalled three times in the Monthly Bulletin that we were working on the limited, but still <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span>, revisions of money figures because of one or two factors, mainly the importance of money market instruments owned by non-EMU residents, which should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in M3. </p>
<p>On your first question, I have nothing further to add to what I have said: a zero rate does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to us to be appropriate at this stage. </p>
<p>As you know, the ECB does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on the budget of the Community. </p>
<p>I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that I will, and I do not intend to be a lame duck. </p>
<p>So, do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> anything, but see it as a reminder of the terms of reference that I have for this particular issue. </p>
<p>Frankly, it does <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> likely today. </p>
<p>Having said that, running such big corporate programmes, it 's <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> that losses <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be happening. </p>
<p>They do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be so far from what we can appreciate now. </p>
<p>They do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be substantial. </p>
<p>I think it is remarkable and I will take this opportunity to mention that it is something really exceptional in the world, but <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span> in Europe. </p>
<p>Our decision certainly does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> mechanistically on any particular input, including the input from the projections, which are an important piece of information for us. </p>
<p>I would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on a more rapid development of whichever exchange rate, as you can understand. </p>
<p>And I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it will have, as far as it has gone now, any impact on the real economy developments, on output and export capabilities. </p>
<p>Yes, but I would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on any kind of shocks. </p>
<p>We <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> see that the explanation we had on the portfolio shifts and then the unwinding of portfolio shifts, which was a convincing element in understanding what was happening, does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> now in our own analysis to be convincing in explaining the present dynamism of M3. </p>
<p>We should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the rate of growth of the monetary aggregate and the overhang, the stock. </p>
<p>Every day actually, <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> every day ! </p>
<p>In our projections the monetary policy stance or the level of interest rates is a so-called exogenous <span class='uncertainty'>variable</span>, so we do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> any change, strictly for - I am <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> inclined to say -" scientific reasons ''. </p>
<p>As you know, when we clarified our monetary policy concept, which was done in 2003, we said that the reference value of 4.5%, which of course exists, was a medium-term reference value, so we would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>reassess</span> the reference value every year. </p>
<p>And that does <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be conducive to growth. </p>
<p>What are the general conditions so as to make sure that we are always there, ready to provide the Greek economy with the needed liquidity, and at the same time we do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> a bank run again? </p>
<p>We do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on any single piece of information or any single model of the economy. </p>
<p>For the time being, we think that it <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> very well be that the allotment ratio will come up again, to a certain point of equilibrium, but it is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> to make a final judgement. </p>
<p>On top of that, there are other conditions for growth and job creation and that do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> on us. </p>
<p>But I am not a prophet and I can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span> precisely when. </p>
<p>So I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> about what we would do if there really were a recession. </p>
<p>What I know is that on inflation outlook, Brexit did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to have any major impact at this point in time. </p>
<p>And the European Parliament did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> so. </p>
<p>Now, deflation does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be just around the corner, but HICP will be safely under the 2% limit we have set as the maximum which is compatible with price stability. </p>
<p>I do n't want to confirm anything except what is in the market as regards future <span class='uncertainty'>probability</span> which, as I said, does <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me aberrant on the basis of the present level of information. </p>
<p>And all this is something that we should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> with deflation, because -- on the contrary -- it is a factor that is expansionary, because we are distributing purchasing power to our fellow citizens through lower prices of oil and commodities. </p>
<p>So the two statements together do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that there was an intension to prepare the markets for an implementation of such measures. </p>
<p>I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> further. </p>
<p>I would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we would change anything at this stage. </p>
<p>As regard your last question I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that, at this stage, taking into account the very important and bold decisions already taken by governments, our democracies will necessarily renew what they accepted to do at the peak of the crisis. </p>
<p>If they did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in this capacity, they would elevate the level of their inflationary expectations and we would immediately have medium - and long-term market interest rates that would be higher, or much higher, or much, much higher. </p>
<p>But - to mention just one example - one of the criteria was that the inflation rate should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>deviate</span> more than 1 1/2 percentage points from the average rate of inflation of the three best-performing countries. </p>
<p>So the present inflation rates are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>, and I have explained the reasons there <span class='uncertainty'>might</span> be. </p>
<p>This is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>possible</span> legally now so it 's an evolution of the system that at present time I judge unsatisfactory and needs to be changed. </p>
<p>What we have seen in the past few cases of elections outcomes does <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that markets reacted in a way that would undermine confidence. </p>
<p>And if we were to restart this exercise at the level of staff at the moment, the figures would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>probably</span> be exactly the same, because a number of factors would have to be taken into account: parameters would have changed in a number of directions. </p>
<p>But since the very beginning we did <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it would be an episode that would not last -- we said it 's an" ongoing process ''. </p>
<p>I never said that because we did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that. </p>
<p>That it does not say that they are appropriate is <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>. </p>
<p>Again, let us <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the appropriate functioning of the money market and the monetary policy stance. </p>
<p>At the same time, we see that we are in a bad equilibrium and, therefore, policy action, though convincing, does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to produce -- at least not in the relatively medium term -- the results for which it is geared. </p>
<p>One should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> these two concepts, as some <span class='uncertainty'>tend</span> to do. </p>
<p>I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that any of these institutions or individuals do not do their job. </p>
<p>The facts and figures that the Governing Council has do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a decrease in nominal values, which is the mark of deflation. </p>
<p>I am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that the fine-tuning of the present situation through fiscal stimulus would be part of it. </p>
<p>We do not and we did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>, theorise or analyse about the size of any change that was not contemplated. </p>
<p>It does <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be directly associated with the financial <span class='uncertainty'>turbulence</span>, so for the present moment what we have in front of us, which calls as I said for further analysis -- very deep analysis, are data that are not reflecting what we have observed since June/July and certainly August, which was the start of the turbulent episode on the financial markets and credit market. </p>
<p>First of all, I have not seen that letter, so I can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what I would answer had I seen it. </p>
<p>As regards our own decision, it was <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<p>I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that hard figures are the only reliable figures or that survey figures are the only reliable figures. </p>
<p>On your question about the present situation, let me first say that we should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the euro as a currency with the issue of the difficulty of preserving financial stability in the euro area as a whole. </p>
<p>I have already responded in terms of volume and, frankly speaking, I think that all the observations about the <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> taken do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> appropriate. </p>
<p>We see a slow, although <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>, increase in the rate of inflation. </p>
<p>But what we do see - as far as inflation is concerned, insofar as we pay attention to current developments - is that inflation is slowly creeping up, but - and <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unexpectedly</span> - due <span class='uncertainty'>almost</span> exclusively to the increase in oil prices which is working its way through into consumer prices and which will <span class='uncertainty'>presumably</span> continue to work its way through. </p>
<p>Very specifically, in the English translation in the Parliament the translators used the word" <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span> '' in a certain context, whereas the word" <span class='uncertainty'>probable</span> '' did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in the French text. </p>
<p>So, we do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> the two, not at all. </p>
<p>We should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>confuse</span> this readjustment of prices, which is actually welcome, with deflation. </p>
<p>I can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> what our next staff projections are likely to be: I will comment on them to you in a month 's time. </p>
<p>I can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what will happen after the war, if and when the war is over. </p>
<p>This is a prouesse -LSB- amazing achievement -RSB- on the part of the euro, because, as I have already said, the markets and global observers did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> in 1997 and 1998 that we <span class='uncertainty'>could</span> deliver a new currency that would be as credible as the best legacy currencies. </p>
<p>But do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that the previous" appropriate '' would mean no change in the future, in the many months to come, for a very long period of time. </p>
<p>No, we all agreed that we have to make quite an effort to speak with" one voice '' because the song we are singing does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> at all, but we <span class='uncertainty'>sometimes</span> need some repetition to achieve full harmony. </p>
<p>I would <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on future developments which I hope will not take place. </p>
<p>I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on that. </p>
<p>From today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p>Let me add that I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that it would be appropriate to introduce the IMF as a supplier of help through standby arrangements or through any such kind of help. </p>
<p>So, again, I would not express anything on any particular country but I would say -- as it was mentioned by ECOFIN -- that we must have stable figures which are <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>dependent</span> on electoral or political cycles. </p>
<p>So a too simple analysis which relies upon the working <span class='uncertainty'>assumption</span> that the same institution does both -- asking for liquidity and replacing in the central bank - does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be right ; it is more complex than that. </p>
<p>We would at this stage <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we consider our growth potential for the euro area to have changed significantly upwards. </p>
<p>I have to say that the futures market does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> to be a good <span class='uncertainty'>predictive</span> indicator when you look at what has happened in the past. </p>
<p>We have not come to a decision on that, so that I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>Again, you can not eliminate a failure, eliminate a drama, but you can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>presume</span> that it is a normal situation to have this kind of private sector involvement. </p>
<p>Regarding the participation in QE, it 's more complex and it does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>depend</span> only on the successful completion of the review. </p>
<p>But the rest of the economy does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be inclined to generate upward pressure on inflation. </p>
<p>I said from today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. </p>
<p>We do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on future changes in interest rates. </p>
<p>We do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> this by any means. </p>
<p>That in fact, as you said, there are spots which have n't seen such great recovery, and they, in a sense, do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> when we give this average, aggregate description. </p>
<p>I can not answer the last question because I do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> on what the" appropriate level '' is for the euro in a world that is ever-changing. </p>
<p>So this criticism does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be grounded, at least as far as we are concerned. </p>
<p>And that would <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> a redesign of the OMT programme, although it has other interesting suggestions for other functions that the ECB is currently performing. </p>
<p>At this stage we do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that we can conclude with sufficient certainty that there has been a change in total factor productivity or in labour productivity that would permit us to say that the growth potential is higher than before. </p>
<p>I am <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggesting</span> that you now have a magic wand and you say:" The euro is there, you create jobs '', but let us be aware of the facts and figures, as always. </p>
<p>In the present particular case, even if the Governing Council did not discuss that, I would say that it does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to me in line with what would be appropriate. </p>
<p>Regarding sterilisation, you should <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>assume</span> that we are not going to sterilise or that we will sterilise -- you have to understand, these operations are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. </p>
<p>Oh, does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be very impressed... </p>
<p>The upside <span class='uncertainty'>risks</span> relate to food prices, which do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>seem</span> to be a major <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> today for euro area inflation for the reason that, first of all, the increases have so far been viewed as one-off shocks. </p>
<p>And to buy equities is, let me put it this way, for many central banks <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unusual</span>. </p>
<p>On the other point about negative rates, let me just say again what I said at the very beginning: From today 's perspective, and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and the return to our price stability objective, we do <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>anticipate</span> that it will be necessary to reduce further rates. </p>
<p>I am not reacting to anybody 's remarks in this area and you will have noted that the word" exchange rate '' did <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>appear</span> in today 's statement. </p>
<p>As to whenever and wherever and how we are going to use it, I will <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span>. </p>
<p>I should also add that the various initiatives do <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>differ</span> amongst themselves in such a radical way as to rule out this eventual convergence. </p>
<p>The most striking figure I can think of is that of loans to non-financial corporations, which are still growing at a rate of 13.9%, which is extraordinarily rapid and does <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>suggest</span> that we are experiencing a credit crunch. </p>
<p>Now, it 's very difficult to distinguish between these three sets of factors, sets of conditions, so we wo <span class='negation'>n't</span> <span class='uncertainty'>speculate</span> exactly on what explanation is the most likely. </p>
<p>It will undoubtedly be discussed at one of the forthcoming meetings, but what the result of that discussion will be, I can <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>predict</span>. </p>
<p>So they are still there but they were <span class='negation'>not</span> <span class='uncertainty'>unexpected</span>. </p>
<div class='section'> <p><b>{'without (2)'}</b></div><p>I <span class='uncertainty'>believe</span> that, although it is true - as you say - that Ireland is <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='uncertainty'>doubt</span> the most, or at least one of the most successful economies in the euro area, the budgetary plans of the Irish Government were clearly out of line with the broad guidelines they had agreed to earlier. </p>
<p>Second, whatever the proposal <span class='uncertainty'>may</span> be, it should be such that the ECB can carry out any tasks assigned to it in an effective, rigorous and independent way, <span class='negation'>without</span> <span class='uncertainty'>risk</span> to its reputation. </p>
